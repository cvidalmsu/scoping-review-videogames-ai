Adaptable procedural content generation (PCG) provides a promising solution to this issue. Extensive literature exists on adaptable PCG techniques, encompassing both offline (during development) and online (during gameplay) approaches. Building upon this foundation, we propose a novel extension called Player-Centric Procedural Content Generation (PCPCG) as an additional tool for creating unique game experiences based on player preferences. In contrast to runtime adaptable PCG methods, which adapt or learn based solely on in-game data, PCPCG actively involves players in the learning loop by soliciting their feedback. Additionally, it shifts the focus from designers (as in mixed initiative (MI) and co-creative PCG) to the players as providers of learning data, thus operating during gameplay rather than during development. PCPCG possesses three key qualities: 1) real-time operation during gameplay, 2) active participation of players (not designers) in the learning loop, and 3) online learning from player feedback to create engaging and personalized content. It is important to differentiate PCPCG from content creation aids and in-game data adaptable PCGs. While PCPCG falls under the umbrella of adaptable PCG, it goes beyond relying solely on in-game data by incorporating valuable player feedback as a vital information source for content generation. PCPCG introduces a novel and promising approach to runtime procedural content generation by leveraging player feedback to create adaptive and personalized game content. While our proof of concept demonstrates the viability of PCPCG in a Pac-Man domain, further research is required to explore its limitations as the complexity of the possibility space increases.",10.1145/3573382.3616069,"New York, NY, USA","['https://doi.org/10.1145/3573382.3616069', 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3573382.3616069']","['adaption, gameplay, personalization, preference learning, procedural content generation']",ACM,,,,

As such, there is untapped potential for creating mixed-initiative games with more complex mechanics in which players can engage with both co-creation and gameplay goals. To explore the potential of more prominent gameplay in mixed-initiative co-creative storytelling games, we created Snake Story, a variation of the classic Snake game featuring a human-AI co-writing element. To explore how players interact with the mixed-initiative game, we conducted a qualitative playtest with 11 participants.

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) enable the generation of game behaviors based on player input at runtime. Such code generation brings with it the possibility of entirely new gameplay interactions that may be difficult to integrate with typical game development workflows. We explore these implications through GROMIT, a novel LLM-based runtime behavior generation system for Unity. When triggered by a player action, GROMIT generates a relevant behavior which is compiled without developer intervention and incorporated into the game. We create three demonstration scenarios with GROMIT to investigate how such a technology might be used in game development. In a system evaluation we find that our implementation is able to produce behaviors that result in significant downstream impacts to gameplay. We then conduct an interview study with n=13 game developers using GROMIT as a probe to elicit their current opinion on runtime behavior generation tools, and enumerate the specific themes curtailing the wider use of such tools. We find that the main themes of concern are quality considerations, community expectations, and fit with developer workflows, and that several of the subthemes are unique to runtime behavior generation specifically.

The authors have worked on both sides of this gap and in an effort to shorten it and increase the synergy between the two sectors have identified three design pillars for PCG using mixed-initiative interfaces. The three pillars are respect designer control, respect the creative process and respect existing work processes. Respecting designer control is about creating a tool that gives enough control to bring out the designer’s vision. Respecting the creative process concerns itself with having a feedback loop that is short enough, that the creative process is not disturbed.

This article presents an expert evaluation of a human-in-the-loop generative design approach for commercial game maps that incorporates multiple computational agents. The evaluation aims to gauge the extent to which such an approach could support and be accepted by human game designers and to determine whether the computational agents improve the overall design. To evaluate the approach, 11 game designers utilized the approach to design game levels with the computational agents both active and inactive. Eye-tracking, observational, and think-aloud data was collected to determine whether designers favored levels suggested by the computational agents. This data was triangulated with qualitative data from semi-structured interviews that were used to gather overall opinions of the approach. The eye-tracking data indicates that the participating game level designers showed a clear preference for levels suggested by the computational agents, however, expert designers in particular appeared to reject the idea that the computational agents are helpful.

However, this assumption does not hold in many real-world settings where AI tools are deployed today (e.g., social work, criminal justice, and healthcare). In this paper, we introduce a process-oriented notion of appropriate reliance called critical use that centers the human’s ability to situate AI predictions against knowledge that is uniquely available to them but unavailable to the AI model. To explore how training can support critical use, we conduct a randomized online experiment in a complex social decision-making setting: child maltreatment screening. We find that, by providing participants with accelerated, low-stakes opportunities to practice AI-assisted decision-making in this setting, novices came to exhibit patterns of disagreement with AI that resemble those of experienced workers.

Raising the level quality is difficult, because it is hard to reason about bugs that can manifest inside generated content. We take the position that debugging requires special attention.

Here, we introduce several PCGRL tasks for the 3D domain, Minecraft. These tasks will challenge RL-based generators using affordances often found in 3D environments, such as jumping, multiple dimensional movement, and gravity. We train agents to optimize each of these tasks to explore the capabilities of existing in PCGRL.

We propose procedural narrative as context through objectives, as a useful means to structure content in games. In this paper, we present and describe an artifact developed as a sub-system to the Evolutionary Dungeon Designer (EDD) that procedurally generates objectives for the dungeons created with the tool. The quality of the content within rooms is used to generate objectives, and together with the distributions and design of the dungeon, main and side objectives are formed to maximize the usage of game space and create a proper context.",10.1145/3383668.3419890,"New York, NY, USA","['https://doi.org/10.1145/3383668.3419890', 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3383668.3419890']","['procedural content generation, mixed-initiative co-creativity']",ACM,,,,

But this comes with the challenge of exploring a large quantity of generated content. This challenge is exacerbated by the lack of proper supporting tools. We contend that such tools should encourage exploration, and respect the nature of design judgment. We present a visual analytics tool, DesignSense, developed as a response to a similar challenge in the architectural design domain. In a case study, we applied DesignSense to a dataset of generated levels for a puzzle game.

JOUR,"['Drake Kajioka, E']",Games That Let Go: Thriving in a Decentralized Future,ACM Games,,,2023,2023/7,Association for Computing Machinery,"In the early years of video games – arcade and home console – a given player could reasonably play every video game of note released in year and still have time for other hobbies. In 2022,10,963 games were released on the Steam platform alone. The scale of video games that enter the market in a given year now radically outstrip the ability of organized, monolithic gaming media to keep up with them. This “viewpoint” essay addresses how content creators can approach the decentralization of gaming culture through the lens of identity and authenticity, while reviewing incoming technologies that support this transition. Communication protocols for trustworthy digital certification, AI-assisted content creation tools, cloud technologies, and a transition from content moderation to user-centered governance – all will play a part in the coming transition to collective sense-making of these now highly complex game markets. Finally, the essay considers new audiences that will support a greater diversity of perspectives in independent game companies who can directly reach and engage players who share their specific experiences and interests.",10.1145/3600235,,"['https://doi.org/10.1145/3600235', 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3600235']","['AI and data, business and production, inclusive gaming, immersive experiences and future realities, and political issues, societal, ethical, audiences and communities, Applied gaming']",ACM,1,2,"New York, NY, USA",

A branch of QD uses genetic operators to generate content (e.g. MAP-Elites). Problematically, levels generated with these operators have no guarantee of matching the style of a game. This can be addressed by incorporating whether a level is generable by an n-gram into the fitness function. Unfortunately, this leads to wasted computation and poor results. In this work, we introduce n-gram genetic operators, which produce only solutions that are generable by the n-gram model; we call MAP-Elites combined with these operators Gram-Elites. We test on a tile-based side-scrolling platformer, vertical platformer, and roguelike. For all three, n-gram operators outperform standard operators and random n-gram generation, finding more usable (i.e. completable and generable) solutions at a faster rate. By integrating structure into operators, instead of fitness, these genetic operators could be beneficial to QD in PCGML.",10.1145/3472538.3472599,"New York, NY, USA","['https://doi.org/10.1145/3472538.3472599', 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3472538.3472599']","['video games, quality-diversity, procedural content generation, n-grams, genetic operators']",ACM,,,,

Drawing upon sound synthesizers and game description languages, Squeezer can synthesize common types of juice effects by combining simple building blocks into sequences. Additionally, Squeezer offers effect generation based on predefined recipes as well as an interface for interactively evolving effect sequences. We conducted a user study with five experts to verify the functionality and interest among game designers. By applying generative and evolutionary strategies to juice effect design, Squeezer allows game designers and researchers using games in their work to explore adding juice effects to their games and frameworks.

CPAPER,"['Langendam, Thijmen Stefanus Leendert', 'Bidarra, Rafael']",miWFC - Designer Empowerment through mixed-initiative Wave Function Collapse,Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on the Foundations of Digital Games,FDG '22,,2022,2022,Association for Computing Machinery,"Wave Function Collapse (WFC) is a powerful generative algorithm, able to create locally-similar output based on a single example input. One of the inherent limitations of the original WFC is that it often requires users to understand its inner workings, and possibly make their own ad-hoc mods, to achieve satisfactory results. Besides distracting from your creative task, this strongly reduces the algorithm’s effective usefulness to a small group of technical users. We propose miWFC, a novel mixed-initiative approach to WFC aimed at overcoming these drawbacks. Its main focus is on providing intuitive control to its users, in a way that matches their usual creative workflow. Among its main features, this approach provides (i) interactive navigation through design history, including controlled backtracking, (ii) precise manual editing of the output for direct expression of design intent, and (iii) interactive manipulation of tile weights, to tweak the global appearance of the output. We evaluated a prototype implementation of our approach among game artists and other creative professionals, and concluded that its features were largely considered useful and supportive of their creative work.",10.1145/3555858.3563266,"New York, NY, USA","['https://doi.org/10.1145/3555858.3563266', 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3555858.3563266']","['wave function collapse, texture synthesis, procedural content generation, mixed-initiative, level generation, interaction design, human-computer interaction, constraint solving']",ACM,,,,
