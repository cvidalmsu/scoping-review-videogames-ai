The surrogate model combines level and ruleset elements as input and gameplay outcomes as output, thus constructing a mapping between three different facets of games. Using this model as a surrogate for expensive gameplay simulations, a search-based generator can adapt content toward a target gameplay outcome. Using a shooter game as the target domain, this paper explores how parameters of the players' character classes can be mapped to both the level's representation and the gameplay outcomes of balance and match duration. The surrogate model is built on a deep learning architecture, trained on a large corpus of randomly generated sets of levels, classes, and simulations from game playing agents. Results show that a search-based generative approach can adapt character classes, levels, or both toward designer-specified targets. The model can thus act as a design assistant or be integrated in a mixed-initiative tool. Most importantly, the combination of three game facets into the model allows it to identify the synergies between levels, rules, and gameplay and orchestrate the generation of the former two toward desired outcomes.",IEEE

It comprises a multiplayer game with asymmetric interaction in which a player must reach the exit of a maze within a time limit, while wearing a head mounted display. The maze is complex and the player could not reach the exit on time without a team there to help her using a large number of printed maps describing candidate mazes. The player describes what she sees to the team who use such information to identify which one of the several available maps the player is currently navigating in virtual reality. Each game requires the generation of hundreds of very similar maps with several aliasing (confusing) situations but at the same time need to have a solution to guarantee that if the team members collaborate effectively they can guide the player to the exit. It would be infeasible for a human designer to provide such a massive number of maps for every game played. Accordingly, we developed automatic authoring tools to help designers generate such large sets of maps and also to optimize them based on design principles focusing on fun and pace. Our preliminary results show that the authoring pipeline we created can generate games (set of maps) adherent to such design principles.",IEEE

This promises quicker learning and learning more complex methods. To gain an insight into the field and to detect emerging trends, we performed a database search. We note a surprisingly late adoption of deep learning that starts in 2018. The introduction of deep learning has not yet solved the greatest challenge of TRL: generalization. Transfer between different domains works well when domains have strong similarities (e.g. MountainCar to Cartpole), and most TRL publications focus on different tasks within the same domain that have few differences. Most TRL applications we encountered compare their improvements against self-defined baselines, and the field is still missing unified benchmarks. We consider this to be a disappointing situation. For the future, we note that: (1) A clear measure of task similarity is needed. (2) Generalization needs to improve. Promising approaches merge deep learning with planning via MCTS or introduce memory through LSTMs. (3) The lack of benchmarking tools will be remedied to enable meaningful comparison and measure progress. Already Alchemy and Meta-World are emerging as interesting benchmark suites. We note that another development, the increase in procedural content generation (PCG), can improve both benchmarking and generalization in TRL.",IEEE

In several applications, the process starts with a bubble diagram or graph derived from a client’s requirements, which is then used as a basis for drawing a blueprint to continue the design process. That process requires a tool to preserve consistency between design models and diminish the design time. Hence, we have developed a Unity plugin to graphically represent a building layout using nodes and edges for rooms and doors that also allow defining the size and aspect ratio of spaces. This abstract representation is then automatically converted into a blueprint and optimized for explicit constraints (doors, size, and ratio) and implicit ones (tightness, convexity) by applying stochastic hill-climbing or steepest ascent hill-climbing algorithms. Then, the user can edit that blueprint further. As a final result, the tool generates a navigable 3D representation of the floor plan for the user to explore and go back to edit it if necessary. Results show that both algorithms are computing efficient enough to apply them interactively in the tool while providing functional building layouts.

In this study, we explored the topic through a PCG application for generating placements of objects representing elements of learning content in a game map. The content consisted of correct answers, which the player must gather in the correct order, and wrong answers, which the player must avoid. We employed an evolutionary algorithm in three stages of the generation: it first generated a minimal set of correct answer element objects (CAEOs), followed by generating a copy of the set, and then a set of wrong answer element objects (WAEOs). We employed and tested a fitness function that calculated the mean and standard deviation of object pair distances. The results show that the generation algorithm is capable of generating CAEOs and WAEOs distributions that are unpredictable and encourage exploration. We find that multiplying the fitness function's standard deviation variable by a specific value, which depends on how many objects are to be generated, is crucial to the algorithm's success.

Nevertheless, there are certain difficulties in integrating GANs into AI games, such as computational resources, mode collapse, training instability, and assessment metrics.as well as legal matters. To tackle these obstacles, multidisciplinary research endeavors and cooperation across academic institutions, corporate entities, and regulatory agencies are necessary. Going forward, new avenues for study and developments in GAN technology hold great potential for getting over these roadblocks and opening up fresh possibilities in AI gaming. We can create a future where AI powered gaming experiences change the parameters of interactive entertainment and provide players globally with more engaging, varied, and personalized gaming experiences by utilizing the possibilities of GANs and addressing the related obstacles.",IEEE

To ensure that these generators' output is sufficiently diverse (that is, not amounting to the reproduction of a single optimal level configuration), the generation process is constrained such that the initial seed results in some variance in the generator's output. However, this results in a loss of control over the generated content for the human user. We propose to train generators capable of producing controllably diverse output, by making them “goal-aware.” To this end, we add conditional inputs representing how close a generator is to some heuristic, and also modify the reward mechanism to incorporate that value. Testing on multiple domains, we show that the resulting level generators are capable of exploring the space of possible levels in a targeted, controllable manner, producing levels of comparable quality as their goal-unaware counterparts, that are diverse along designer-specified dimensions.",IEEE

Considering such aspects, this paper proposes a strategy for procedurally generating dungeons using ML techniques. We use Unity ML-Agents tool for the implementation, since dungeons are environments largely used in the industry that also require more control over its creation. The strategy used in this paper has proven to generate dungeons that respect room positioning design choices and maintains the game characterization.

Rather than merely analyzing these algorithms, our focus is on addressing their inherent drawbacks. Specifically, we aim to find solutions to enhance their utility in game development, particularly in terms of improving path lengths and increasing the diversity of generated mazes.
