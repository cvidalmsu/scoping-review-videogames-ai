These issues refer to the generation of endlessly similar, unengaging content and the devaluation of content due to its infinite producibility, respectively. By integrating design thinking, computational-cognitive heuristics, and prompt engineering with modern machine intelligence tools, we propose a novel approach termed Procedural Woodworking (PWw). This methodology aims to generate unique worlds and narratives through LLMs while enhancing player engagement by embedding a player's character into the game's narrative in a meaningful way. We utilize OpenAI's ChatGPT-4 to create custom GPTs for world-building and narrative generation, evaluating their novelty and logical consistency through comparative rating scales. Our results indicate that both Top-Down and Bottom-Up world-building methods can produce logically consistent and structurally coherent outputs. The Procedural Woodworking approach, in particular, shows promise in generating novel narrative content that aligns with pre-made human-designed fictional worlds, potentially mitigating the identified procedural generation problems. This study lays the groundwork for further investigation into how LLMs can enrich game design and player experience by offering a more personalized and value-driven narrative generation process.

PCG refers to techniques for creating game content algorithmically, by manipulating data through sets of computational operations and parameters. By producing scalable results with combinatorial diversity, procedural generation is touted as the future of content, yet flouted as the harbinger of technological unemployment in game art production. Critical scholarship on automation suggests that the real danger is not job loss per se, but the constitution of an underclass of artists whose vital work of conditioning algorithmic outputs is denigrated as derivative and ‘manual’. Framed by liberal humanist ideas of agency, PCG naturalizes trade-offs where the autonomy of generative machines is contingent upon the automatism of its human conditioners. This qualitative analyses of talks on PCG at the Game Developers Conference (2015–2020) shows how procedural systems bifurcate the creative work of algorithmic cultural production into affective and mechanical forms of conditioning that map onto stratifications of racial capitalism. Affective tuning resists documentation and is reserved for artists with technomasculine forms of cultural capital; mechanical tuning is relegated to automatable and outsourced labour and relies on replicable technique that is considered artistic but not creative. This article argues that PCG’s reclassification of creativity through racialised dialectics of human agency and machine automaticity overlooks the autonomy of procedural systems. PCG pipelines are organised less around the agency of human toolmakers and more around the autonomy of systems that assimilate tasks in the management of complex networks of dependencies. Instead of pitting artists against machines, this analysis politicises automation’s racial stratifications by examining the momentum of more-than-human systems in which toolmakers and tool users negotiate granularities of control and degrees of concession. © The Author(s) 2022.","['automation', 'computational creativity', 'creative industries', 'digital game production', 'digital labour', 'outsourcing', 'Procedural generation', 'racial capitalism']",SAGE Publications Ltd,13548565 (ISSN),English,Convergence,Article,Scopus,"['Export Date: 06 January 2025; Cited By: 13; Correspondence Address: A.

In this context, crowd and traffic simulations are most commonly utilized. Urban intelligent traffic management and pedestrian flow analysis greatly benefits from the latest generation of 3D City Information Models created from accurate urban-scale geospatial information. Analysis and simulation tools based on geometric, semantic, morphological, and structural information at the urban scale level offer the scientific foundation for all the activities required for identifying, detecting, planning, training, and analyzing vulnerability that may threaten human lives in urban environments. Nevertheless, the literature research showed that samples of operational Digital Twins incorporating simulation capabilities are impracticable for small municipalities and rural, low-income communities due to their complex infrastructure, hardware, and data requirements. It is desirable to reduce the requirements for these Digital Twins and still be capable of running comprehensive and accurate simulations based on urban-scale geospatial information. This article proposes an innovative framework and workflow capable of generating an operational Digital Twin and its visualization in the form of a 3D model using a procedural approach. The Digital Twin is connected with the traffic simulation SUMO and the Game Engine Unity for visualization using the TraCI middleware. The middleware is extended with additional functionalities and acts as an authoring tool. Unity allows visualizations in VR. The entire framework can be run on a single, standalone computer and is ready in a matter of minutes. The proposed framework for integrating modeling, simulation, and visualization of operational Digital Twins can help guide better decision-making for both rural areas as well as cities.

Game developers usually reach for commercial off-the-shelf components often available in the engine’s marketplace to reduce costs. Mixed-initiative authoring tools allow us to combine the thoughtful work of human designers with the productivity gains of automated techniques. However, most commercial AI-assisted Procedural Content Generation tools focus on generating small independent components, and standalone research tools available for generating full game levels with state-of-the-art algorithms usually lack integration with commercial game engines. This article aims to fill this gap between industry and academia. The Level Building Sidekick (LBS) is a mixed-initiative procedural content generation tool built by our research lab in association with four small independent game studios. It has a modular software architecture that enables developers to extend it for their particular projects. The current version has two working modules for building game maps, an early version of a module for populating the level with NPCs or items, and the first stages of a quest editor module. An automated testing module is planned. LBS is distributed as an AI-Assisted videogame-level editor Unity package. Usability testing performed using the “Think-Aloud” methodology indicates LBS has the potential to improve game development processes convincingly. However, at this stage, the user interface and the AI recommendations could improve their intuitiveness. As a general comment, the tool is perceived as a substantial contribution to facilitating and shortening development times, compared to only using the base game engine. There is an untapped market for mixed-initiative tools that assist the game designer in creating complete game levels. We expect to fill that market for our partner development studios and provide the community with an open research and development platform in a standard game engine.

Taking into account the persistent strong social gradient, it will be discuss recommendations towards young people. Background In Belgium, much of the reduction in the prevalence of tobacco use in young people can be attributed to general long-term policies, most of them adopted during the last twenty years at the federal and regional levels such as: - legal measures: • smoking ban in schools, indoor public places, cars when a minor is present, • advertising ban, neutral packaging, • gradual increase in taxation; - adoption of health promotion policies encouraging protective factors related to addiction. A legal and social process to denormalize tobacco use has been implemented and produced results in particular for young people. Results Recurrent surveys on teenagers 10 -17 yrs from the Health Observatory of Hainaut (HOH,CSSV network) since 1997 report significant progress towards a smoke-free generation. For example, although the province of Hainaut has a disadvantaged context compared to other Belgian provinces, current smoking prevalence fell to 7.0% in 2020 (age 16) compared to 30% in 1997. Moreover, these progresses are not equally distributed among socio-economic groups: In 2020, current smoking prevalence among 15-17 yrs old was 12.5% among professional training school, against 2,9% for general education. Discussion New measures included in the inter-federal plan could be the tool to reach an end-game. Among them: smoking ban on railway station platform, prohibition at external entrances to schools, display ban and reduction of sale points, pouches ban, puffbars ban, automat display ban, increase in taxes; etc. … Particular attention should be paid to ensure that young people from disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds can benefit from these positive developments.

Using procedural generation, No Man’s Sky offers nearly infinite planets, flora, and fauna on the fly. With the rapid development of gaming technology and tools, game developers and others are attempting to diversify the representation of various forms of nature in gaming content and to expand the use of games in behavioral change, education, conservation, and other fields. Many scholars argue that games offer promising ways for various publics to understand their place and their interconnectedness with microbes, ecosystems, planet Earth, and beyond. We examine how No Man’s Sky struggled to coproduce digital outer space natures at the two scalar extremes of the vast expanse of outer space and of the embodied player relating within complex biomes. Our results from an in-depth, qualitative analysis of the initial version of the game, of player world-building experiences in No Man’s Sky, and of subsequent developer modifications to the game demonstrate that nonscalability theory is useful for studying what digital outer space natures do in games. We also argue that nonscalability theory would benefit from a more robust engagement with the digital. No Man’s Sky was initially scalable to such an extreme that it made players into objects without an origin story, broader purpose or way to build meaningful relations in the game.

Subsequent updates to the game introduced a limited scope of nonscalability, but only to the extent of satisfying gamers’ desires to become more impactful agents of exploration.

Adaptable procedural content generation (PCG) provides a promising solution to this issue. Extensive literature exists on adaptable PCG techniques, encompassing both offline (during development) and online (during gameplay) approaches. Building upon this foundation, we propose a novel extension called Player-Centric Procedural Content Generation (PCPCG) as an additional tool for creating unique game experiences based on player preferences. In contrast to runtime adaptable PCG methods, which adapt or learn based solely on in-game data, PCPCG actively involves players in the learning loop by soliciting their feedback. Additionally, it shifts the focus from designers (as in mixed initiative (MI) and co-creative PCG) to the players as providers of learning data, thus operating during gameplay rather than during development. PCPCG possesses three key qualities: 1) real-time operation during gameplay, 2) active participation of players (not designers) in the learning loop, and 3) online learning from player feedback to create engaging and personalized content. It is important to differentiate PCPCG from content creation aids and in-game data adaptable PCGs. While PCPCG falls under the umbrella of adaptable PCG, it goes beyond relying solely on in-game data by incorporating valuable player feedback as a vital information source for content generation. PCPCG introduces a novel and promising approach to runtime procedural content generation by leveraging player feedback to create adaptive and personalized game content. While our proof of concept demonstrates the viability of PCPCG in a Pac-Man domain, further research is required to explore its limitations as the complexity of the possibility space increases.  © 2023 Owner/Author.","['adaption', 'gameplay', 'personalization', 'preference learning', 'procedural content generation', 'Adaption', 'Content creation', 'Customisation', 'Game contents', 'Gameplay', 'Personalizations', 'Preference learning', 'Procedural content generations', 'Real- time', 'Runtimes']","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",979-840070029-3 (ISBN),English,CHI PLAY - Companion Proc.

Creating those maps by artists can take a long time. In this paper we propose a solution for automatic creation of such maps, that can then be used as a support tool for creating a baseline map to work on by artists, or as an automatic map generator. The general approach of creating maps using our solution is briefly explained, and then a closer look at the ground part of the map creation process is taken. Our algorithm takes as an input a list of tiles to be used and a rough sketch of a map to be generated, prepared with specific colours. It then creates a tile grid from that sketch using simple downscaling. That tile grid is then corrected using methods proposed in this paper, so that it does not have sharp edges and mismatched tiles. Finally, using tiles from input, the grid is transformed into an output map that closely resembles the sketch in its structure. Our solution is tested in practice by means of several exemplary sketches, each accompanied with comment explaining the significance of obtained result. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","['Automatic Map Generation', 'Digital Role Playing Games', 'Tiled Maps', 'Interactive computer graphics', 'Maps', 'Automatic creations', 'Automatic map generation', 'Digital role playing game', 'Ground level', 'Map generation', 'Role-playing game', 'Support tool', 'Tiled map', 'Topdown', 'Two-dimensional', 'Social networking (online)']",Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,23673370 (ISSN); 978-303122024-1 (ISBN),English,Lect.

To explore the potential of more prominent gameplay in mixed-initiative co-creative storytelling games, we created Snake Story, a variation of the classic Snake game featuring a human-AI co-writing element. To explore how players interact with the mixed-initiative game, we conducted a qualitative playtest with 11 participants.

The SmartSpeech project aims to assist clinicians in decision making regarding early diagnosis for children with neurodevelopmental disorders. SmartSpeech employs a serious game designed explicitly by the interdisciplinary team for this project, with activities aiming to evaluate the child’s developmental profile. The game is implemented in a tablet application and utilizes voice, and biomarkers of heart rate and gaze, for additional physiological measurements. A back-end system supports user registration, data collection, data analysis, and decision making. The potential application of this work is to allow the SmartSpeech machine learning model to better capture underlying patterns in the data, determine the most effective feature construction techniques for the given problem, and employ the results of this study to enhance the screening automated prediction results of the machine learning model in neurodevelopmental disorders. Developmental domains refer to different areas of a child’s growth and maturation, including physical, language, cognitive, and social–emotional skills. Understanding these domains helps parents, caregivers, and professionals track a child’s progress and identify potential areas of concern. Nevertheless, due to the high level of heterogeneity and overlap, neurodevelopmental disorders may go undiagnosed in children for a crucial period. Detecting neurodevelopmental disorders at an early stage is fundamental. Digital tools like artificial intelligence can help clinicians with the early detection process. To achieve this, a new method has been proposed that creates artificial features from the original ones derived from the SmartSpeech project, using a feature construction procedure guided by the Grammatical Evolution technique. The new features from a machine learning model are used to predict neurodevelopmental disorders. Comparative experiments demonstrated that using the feature creation method outperformed other machine learning methods for predicting neurodevelopmental disorders. In many cases, the reduction in the test error reaches up to 65% to the next better one. © 2023 by the authors.","['evolutionary techniques', 'feature construction', 'grammatical evolution', 'neurodevelopmental disorders', 'screening']",Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),20763417 (ISSN),English,Appl.

In several applications, the process starts with a bubble diagram or graph derived from a client's requirements, which is then used as a basis for drawing a blueprint to continue the design process. That process requires a tool to preserve consistency between design models and diminish the design time. Hence, we have developed a Unity plugin to graphically represent a building layout using nodes and edges for rooms and doors that also allow defining the size and aspect ratio of spaces. This abstract representation is then automatically converted into a blueprint and optimized for explicit constraints (doors, size, and ratio) and implicit ones (tightness, convexity) by applying stochastic hill-climbing or steepest ascent hill-climbing algorithms. Then, the user can edit that blueprint further. As a final result, the tool generates a navigable 3D representation of the floor plan for the user to explore and go back to edit it if necessary. Results show that both algorithms are computing efficient enough to apply them interactively in the tool while providing functional building layouts.

However, when it comes to homemade maze generation, there's often a limitation in providing the necessary diversity of mazes to maintain player engagement. Predictability can creep in, diminishing the player's experience. In this composition, we embark on a comprehensive exploration of three introductory 2-D maze-generation algorithms, firstly, DFS (Depth-First Search), secondly, Recursive description, and lastly Prim's-Method algorithm. Rather than merely analyzing these algorithms, our focus is on addressing their inherent drawbacks. Specifically, we aim to find solutions to enhance their utility in game development, particularly in terms of improving path lengths and increasing the diversity of generated mazes.

However, the relationship between AI and human designers in creative processes is delicate, as adjusting the initiative or agency of the AI can negatively affect the user experience. In this paper, different degrees of agency for the AI are explored within the Evolutionary Dungeon Designer (EDD) to further understand MI-CC tools.

As the composer, sound designer, and computer music designer, I propose to study Nobody as a playful game. I show how current ludomusicology insights can be used and adapted to a game that is played in a physical space. After first exposing considerations of both technical and aesthetic aspects, I explain the artistic choices made for creating the soundtrack of six interactive puzzles. Through practice-led research of these different mini music games, I analyze how the influence of electronic dance music (EDM) and related club culture are melded together into the development of the plot and its retrofuturistic theme. I show how constraints forced me to adapt the audio content yet also opened a wide range of musical possibilities. The analysis helps clarify how what I call “game music” differs from “background music”. Moreover, the discussion highlights compositional issues that are similar to video game music-making and shows that escape rooms need to be studied further within the field of ludomusicology. Although some of the analytical tools remain valid because of their technical aspect (transition types, typology of music games, transition speed quantization) or their theoretical aspects (ALI model, branching-layering concept, triple lock of synchronization), traditional concepts such as “immersion” or “game feel” need to be questioned for escape room games, as that type of game takes place in a physical space. © 2023 by the Society for the Study of Sound and Music in Games.

State machine diagrams are among several approaches available for describing behavior. They are appropriate for capturing and understanding behavior rules of systems that can be described in terms of possible states and state transitions. Tools that offer state machine automation enable modelers to test the activation of states and trace the transitions between states, providing assistance with verification and validation of the behavior logic. The United States Military Academy (USMA) at West Point’s Robotics Research Center (RRC) in collaboration with the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS), developed a minimal executable state machine model to test its implementation of behavior logic for a single robot agent in Project Aquaticus, a human-robot teaming capture the flag competition. Monterey Phoenix, a formal behavior modeling language, approach, and tool was used to express the behavior logic of the robots participating in this game as a finite state machine model. MP was used to generate every possible trace through the state machine behavior logic up to the specified scope limit. This model informed the team’s understanding of the desired states for the single robot competitor in Aquaticus, assisted in identifying behavior improvements, and identifying dependencies among behaviors and where the process could possibly go wrong. In essence, this work demonstrates that encoding the finite state machine of the single robot tasks in MP allows experts to verify and validate expected robot behaviors and adjust as needed. Future work will look to expand from the single agent modeling to multi-agent modeling in MP to generate and verify possible sequences of events for the Aquaticus competition between competing teams. By using this modeling method to understand the state of each actor and their response to inputs from other actors, the team expects to improve the communication within the human-robot team and ultimately achieve a better understanding of command intent in complex, contested environments. Today’s mission-critical systems are actually, “systems of systems” with complexity that will surpass the designer’s cognitive ability to anticipate all interactions. Without tools, languages, and methodologies to analyze system-level behavior early in the design, mission systems can be at risk of emergent behaviors that may negatively impact safety and security. Our team believes that the MP environment can assist commanders in anticipating potentially unsafe or insecure emergent behaviors of human-robot teams in complex, contested environments and adjust human intent/command intent accordingly for allowable combat crew drill behaviors required to achieve assigned tasks and missions. © 2023 SPIE.","['Aquaticus', 'behavior modeling', 'command intent', 'emergent behaviors', 'event streams', 'finite state machine', 'formal methods', 'human intent', 'human-robot teaming', 'Monterey Phoenix', 'scenario generation', 'verification and validation', 'Cognitive systems', 'Computer circuits', 'Encoding (symbols)', 'Formal verification', 'Multi agent systems', 'Aquaticu', 'Behaviour models', 'Command intent', 'Emergent behaviours', 'Event streams', 'Finite states machine', 'Human intent', 'Human robots', 'Human-robot teaming', 'Monterey phoenix', 'Scenarios generation', 'Verification-and-validation', 'Modeling languages']",SPIE,0277786X (ISSN); 978-151066204-9 (ISBN),English,Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng,Conference paper,Scopus,"['Export Date: 06 January 2025; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: T.

Methodology The study involved 80 undergraduate students: 40 students pursuing an AA degree and 40 pursuing an AS degree. The design of the innovation game incorporated cognitivist learning strategies based on Bloom’s taxonomy. Innovation skills were evaluated through an open-ended achievement test. Findings The study revealed that DGBL effectively enhances product innovation skills by integrating cognitive strategies, and Bloom’s Taxonomy into guided answers, and open-ended achievement tests. AS students excelled in problem identification and idea creation, while AA students emphasised psychological, emotional factors and visualisation representation. Significance The findings suggest promoting interdisciplinary collaboration among educators and policymakers to integrate aesthetics and technological knowledge. This approach enables students from diverse disciplines to leverage their strengths for holistic innovation. For practical applications, game designers and educators can model product innovation steps, offer guided answers, track progress and award virtual badges. The open-ended achievement test is a valuable tool for assessing innovation skills across diverse student backgrounds.

Design/methodology/approach: A semi-structured interview was first employed to confirm the primary indicator for training programs and criteria design as the pivotal factor for operational efficiency. An observation experiment was subsequently conducted to reveal that the training program can be redesigned according to the concrete operation effects and influencing factors for operational efficiency in the workplace. Findings: The proposed service efficiency-oriented training model is suggested to underline and guide the activities for training requirements, training methods, training criteria and training evaluation for the service sector. Training auditing, analyzing and redesigning based on service efficiency could help to integrate service efficiency so that service organizations can readjust their specific training needs and concise the training program in the human resource management practice. Research limitations/implications: This study only conducted an on-site observational experiment on one of the casinos in Macau. An observational method assessed the conceptual model in the context of table game operations. More quantitative approaches like AI-assisted systems may be employed in the future. The representativeness of the sample is somewhat limited. In addition, the service efficiency-oriented training concept model is an open system that any organization could extend by incorporating more elements in each part that can be developed to meet their human resource management needs. Finally, other service-oriented organizations like airlines and banks can learn from the theoretical model proposed in this article. It is suggested that non-profit organizations would be a better research area. Practical implications: The finding can provide organizations and practitioners with insights and tools on how to provide and evaluate service efficiency and assess employee performance. Social implications: The proposed service efficiency-oriented training model provides a theoretical foundation for training and organizational performance for service organizations.

A common application of these techniques, especially involving text generation, is the construction of conversational agents. In education, generative artificial intelligence has the potential to transform the learning process and enable new forms of teaching, such as the practical application of concepts studied in class and the acquisition of new knowledge through the interaction with computational tools. In Brazil, literature teachers often complain about students' resistance to the content and insufficient reading practice. To address these challenges, this work presents a serious game in which students can chat with Machado de Assis, an important writer of the Brazilian literature. The game was developed by integrating with ChatGPT. The validation was conducted with 15 high school students for them to interpret the book ""Dom Casmurro"". The MEEGA+ instrument was used to evaluate the usability and the experience with the game. The main findings were that students better understood the book, found the game easy to use, and felt immersed in the conversation with Machado de Assis, although they assessed the texts as long and tiring. In a world dominated by faster and visually stimulating forms of entertainment, such as video games and social networks, students may have different expectations regarding the reading experience. If they are not used to reading denser and more introspective texts, they may find it difficult to maintain interest when chatting with Machado de Assis. Finally, another implicit point in the game dynamics is observed: the (re)signification of the methodology to be adopted by the teacher, who will perceive the need to complement interactions with the writer in class according to what he can or should answer, tending to responses that stimulate students to study more about what is within the realm of knowledge about Machado de Assis. © 2024 Dechema e.V..

However, existing AI methods often involve a high number of parameters, resulting in the laborious workload during model training and implementation. In this study, we develop a lightweight damage identification framework embedded with an optimized extreme learning machine (ELM) using a significantly reduced number of parameters from frequency features of the structural vibrational signals. Coupled with the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD), the frequency features were abstracted from the structural vibrational signals in the data pre-processing step. Then, a metaheuristic algorithm (chaos game optimization, CGO) was chosen to optimize the model weight of the ELM to guarantee damage identification accuracy. Once the model is trained, the structural damages can be precisely identified despite the noise-contaminated data. We validated the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed framework with a public database and compare its performance with several common metaheuristic algorithms. With the proven capability, the proposed framework shows a promising future as a handy and reliable AI-assisted digital tool for robust development in next-generation structural monitoring systems. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","['Chaos game optimization', 'Damage identification', 'Ensemble empirical mode decomposition', 'Extreme learning machine', 'Damage detection', 'Data handling', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Machine learning', 'Optimization', 'Structural health monitoring', 'Chaos game optimization', 'Damage Identification', 'Empirical Mode Decomposition', 'Ensemble empirical mode decomposition', 'Extreme learning machine', 'Frequency features', 'Learning machines', 'Meta-heuristics algorithms', 'Optimisations', 'Vibrational signals', 'Empirical mode decomposition']",Academic Press,08883270 (ISSN),English,Mech Syst Signal Process,Article,Scopus,"['Export Date: 06 January 2025; Cited By: 6; Correspondence Address: N.

However, contrary to popular expectations, this total automation approach has not amended the issue of labor shortages in the machining industry, and the workforce demand gap has been gradually expanding in recent years. Although the workforce shortage issue is a complicated and multidimensional problem, it can be seen that one of its underlying causes is the conventional approach to training prospective employees in the industry. Unfortunately, evaluation of outdated training methods, along with discussing possibilities for their improvement, have not yet attracted sufficient attention. In order to effectively accomplish training goals, instructor-led and hands-on training methods are widely adopted in most machining training programs. However, the aspect of trainee engagement, interest and involvement is often ignored, which can be one of the main reasons for dropping enrollment and retention rates observed in many machining related programs in trade schools and community colleges. To spark the interest of the younger generation in this career field, more attention should be paid to incorporating training methods that are attractive to young students. Interactive training programs with game-derived elements are potentially a good solution to address the shortcomings of current training methods. Gamification, which is a technique of facilitating training and learning procedures by incorporating game-like elements, has the potential to enhance student interest and engagement. In such a gamified application, game design elements and gameplay mechanics are added to motivate trainees to stay engaged when performing often repetitive and mundane machine tool operations. It can also help with mitigating the mental fatigue trainees and workers might experience due to lack of interest and professional burnout syndromes observed in machining environments. Gamification is a promising approach to improving self-motivation by stimulating the desire of pursuing gaming-inspired goals (such as for example earning a level-up badge or attaining certain rewards). By connecting the training tasks and outcomes to a gaming goal, trainees would be more likely to derive actual enjoyment from the training procedures and feel less like they are being forced to perform certain tasks and activities. The objective of the proposed study is to devise a surveying method to systematically evaluate the conventional machining workforce development procedures by applying the Octalysis gamification design framework, comprising eight core drives of gamification and their corresponding scores. The outcome of this study is the proposal of a new perspective of evaluating the current machining training methods in the aspect of student attraction and engagement and exploring possibilities to improve them with appropriate game-like elements. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2023.","['Design', 'Engineering education', 'Machine tools', 'Motivation', 'Personnel training', ""'current"", 'Design frameworks', 'Game-like elements', 'Gamification', 'Labor shortages', 'Machining Process', 'Multidimensional problems', 'Training methods', 'Training procedures', 'Training program', 'Students']",American Society for Engineering Education,21535965 (ISSN),English,ASEE Annu.

Depending on their levels of expertise, end users being onboarded to a new dashboard can be either confused and overwhelmed or disinterested and disengaged. We propose interactive dashboard tours (D-Tours) as semi-automated onboarding experiences that preserve the agency of users with various levels of expertise to keep them interested and engaged. Our interactive tours concept draws from open-world game design to give the user freedom in choosing their path through onboarding. We have implemented the concept in a tool called D-TOUR PROTOTYPE, which allows authors to craft custom interactive dashboard tours from scratch or using automatic templates. Automatically generated tours can still be customized to use different media (e.g., video, audio, and highlighting) or new narratives to produce an onboarding experience tailored to an individual user. We demonstrate the usefulness of interactive dashboard tours through use cases and expert interviews. Our evaluation shows that authors found the automation in the D-Tour Prototype helpful and time-saving, and users found the created tours engaging and intuitive.

This article presents an expert evaluation of a human-in-the-loop generative design approach for commercial game maps that incorporates multiple computational agents. The evaluation aims to gauge the extent to which such an approach could support and be accepted by human game designers and to determine whether the computational agents improve the overall design. To evaluate the approach, 11 game designers utilized the approach to design game levels with the computational agents both active and inactive. Eye-tracking, observational, and think-aloud data was collected to determine whether designers favored levels suggested by the computational agents. This data was triangulated with qualitative data from semi-structured interviews that were used to gather overall opinions of the approach. The eye-tracking data indicates that the participating game level designers showed a clear preference for levels suggested by the computational agents, however, expert designers in particular appeared to reject the idea that the computational agents are helpful. The perception of computational tools not being useful needs to be addressed if procedural content generation approaches are to fulfill their potential for the game industry. © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

In this work, we present a novel framework for automatic plan generation that utilizes text-based representations of students’ actions within a game-based learning environment, Crystal Island, to inform adaptive scaffolding of student goal setting and planning, which are critical elements of self-regulated learning. Plan generation is the task of automatically generating a set of low-level actions that contribute toward accomplishing a target goal given a sequence of student gameplay and their prior completed goals. We investigate the use of two pre-trained large language models, T5 and GPT-3.5, in the plan generation framework. The models utilize 144 middle school students gameplay data, encompassing a total of 11,610 event sequences, as input. The plans generated by the model are subsequently evaluated against plans crafted by students during gameplay utilizing an in-game planning support tool in Crystal Island. We compare automatically generated plans to students’ manually generated in terms of the number of matching low-level actions, the number of actions that match when mapped to higher-level categories of actions, and the distribution of categories of actions within plans. Results indicate that automatically generated plans from both models largely align in terms of the high-level categories of actions that are included, but the generated plans feature fewer low-level actions than students’ plans. Plans generated by T5 align more closely with student plans, whereas GPT-3.5, though not following student planning patterns, produces valid plans as well. These findings suggest that LLMs show significant promise for automatically generating plans that can be used to devise run-time adaptive scaffolding for student planning in game-based learning environments. © International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society 2024.","['Game-based learning environments', 'Goal setting and planning', 'Language models', 'Self-regulated learning', 'Computational linguistics', 'Computer aided instruction', 'Crystals', 'Learning systems', 'Scaffolds', 'Automatically generated', 'Crystal islands', 'Game-based learning environments', 'Gameplay', 'Goal setting and planning', 'Goal-setting', 'Language model', 'Plan generation', 'Self-regulated learning', 'Student learning', 'Students']",Springer,15604292 (ISSN),English,Int.

DALL-E Mini uses an unfiltered database of images from the internet to create new images based on a user’s text prompt, often resulting in misshapen bodies and impossible scenarios. Despite its technological limitations, DALL-E Mini’s popularity as a meme-making tool is visible on social media platforms, where crowd-sourced images are shared and experimentation with the tool is encouraged. Through comparison with existing artistic practices and formats (creative automata, surrealism, body horror, celebrity memes), we argue that DALL-E Mini creations can be understood as human-AI co-creations and forms of aesthetic mimicry. Building on the ideas of surrealists such as André Breton, we propose that DALL-E Mini’s images, prompts and the grid interface adhere to surrealism’s historical interests in the unconscious, the uncanny, and the collaborative ‘exquisite corpse’ parlour game. We also consider DALL-E Mini’s relevance to the category of ‘AI Arts’, Patricia De Vries’s call for more research that relates algorithms to the broader artistic and cultural contexts in which they are embedded (2020), and the ‘authoring’ of celebrity bodies as data (Kanai, 2016). Our theorisation of DALL-E Mini is supported by examples drawn from social media and personal experiments with the generator. Overall, we propose that internet users’ experimentation with DALL-E Mini corresponds with a cultural moment in which AI imaging technologies are eliciting excitement and anxiety. The outputs are revealed to be reliant on users’ pop cultural knowledge, with DALL-E Mini allowing for a playful, co-creative algorithmic practice, wherein contemporary anxieties about digital labour, (post)digital culture, biopolitics, and global issues are redirected into surreal visual storyworlds. © The Author(s) 2023.","['algorithmic anxiety', 'algorithmic culture', 'body horror', 'DALL-E Mini', 'digital culture', 'memes', 'pop culture', 'screen media', 'social media', 'storyboards', 'storytelling', 'surrealism', 'text-to-image synthesis', 'visual culture, media archaeology']",SAGE Publications Ltd,13548565 (ISSN),English,Convergence,Article,Scopus,"['Export Date: 06 January 2025; Cited By: 15; Correspondence Address: J.

To assess the effectiveness of this method, a 6-month Chinese-English bilingual extracurricular reading comparative experiment was conducted involving 85 grade 5 students from two classes in a primary school in Hangzhou, China. The AI-assisted class freely read 100 bilingual/English electronic picture books and 200 Chinese electronic classic serial picture books by employing the AI-assisted human-computer interactive electronic reading mode of the “Educational Robot+Audio Electronic Picture Book+Character-play Based Reading.” In contrast, the paper book group read the same content presented in the traditional paper book format, following the “regular independent reading” mode. Post-experimental analyses were conducted employing t-tests and MANCOVA and the results revealed that: the primary factors influencing reading effectiveness are the choice of reading materials, reading tools, and reading mode, while reading time does not emerge as the principal influencing factor. Furthermore, students in the AI class demonstrated significant enhancements in bilingual reading motivation, reading amount, reading comprehension, independent learning ability, pronunciation proficiency, and test scores compared to their peers in the paper book class. The AI-assisted reading mode utilizing educational robots garnered positive feedback from teachers, parents, and students. It offers the potential to effectively substitute parental involvement in parent–child reading and English tutoring, while also enabling the simultaneous acquisition of bilingual proficiency in both Chinese and English. This approach proves to be highly effective, cost-efficient, and convenient, particularly for enhancing children’s foreign language abilities. Moreover, it fosters positive reading habits and independent learning skills among primary school students, contributes to the establishment of lofty aspirations, and enhances bilingual performance.

With significant developments in computer graphics tools, deep learning methods, and immersive experiences (metaverse), there is a need to study its seamless adaptation to AR-based manufacturing-specific scenarios, especially for worker training. In this work, we develop an augmented reality-based worker training framework aimed at helping novice technicians with complex machine component identification in several smart factory tasks and shop-floor training environments. A Deep-Learning (DL) semantic segmentation network U-Net, prominently applied in several manufacturing use cases, is enhanced for detailed pixel-level component identification. We formulated an automatic synthetic image generation algorithm that uses computer-aided design (CAD) models generated using Siemens NX to create images and automatic labels for training the neural network. These images are custom-rendered with variable lighting and randomized orientations to mimic real-life occlusions and improve data diversity for neural network training. In this approach, arbitrary textured materials are assigned to the 3D objects through Blender, an open-source computer graphics software using Python programming in the input scene environment. The background for these images is set from the multiple real-world environment scenes. A custom Python script integrated into Blender captures the image snapshots through the built-in camera system. It automatically separates render and mask images, thus saving time on the tedious manual labeling process. We pass the virtual images (both render and mask images) to the DL pipeline for training. After training the data through Pytorch and CUDA parallel computing, the Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) format output model is imported to the AR app. The application is developed using the Unity 3D game engine platform and deployed on Android. Specifically, the Unity Barracuda toolkit maps the input and output tensors as rendering textures and recognizes components in colored pixels. We present a prototype three-a stage automotive engine assembly case study to evaluate the proposed framework’s effectiveness. The engine components include tools (mallet, chisel, wrench), machine tooling equipment (nuts, bolts, Allen keys, screwdriver), and assembly equipment (engine piston, cylinder head, and camshaft). The 3D-printed components mimicking engine parts are identified in real-time along their exact pixel-level contours in the AR app. This framework can extend AR-based methods to visualize components in complex wiring, cluttered environments, and intricate assemblies on the factory floor, reducing the training time performed through conventional approaches and providing an interactive training approach through gamification.

After data manipulation and consolidation, statistical analyses were performed in order to understand how the IPC has adapted to the algorithm logic of platforms. Our findings demonstrate that YouTube should be comprehended as complementing and substituting television as the traditional medium of sport consumption. Thus, the digitalisation of the sport industry adapts and continues, rather than revolutionises, the symbiotic sport/media relationship.

If they are relevant to the problem they solve, most of them are platform- or language-dependent. To solve this problem, the use of formal models for scenario or activity generation is essential to ensure a high-quality experience. In this context, the use of Petri nets or automata is widespread. Based on this observation, we propose the formal CIT (content interaction time) model [37], which is dedicated to the development of interactive robotic applications and based on networks of input/output timed automata. In this paper, we propose the use of the CELTIC (Common Editor for Location Time Interaction and Content) and EDAIN (Execution Driver based on Artificial INtelligence) software platforms to allow for a simplified and generic modelling of robotic applications and their supervision based on the CIT model. We used this approach to design a serious game with the humanoid robot Nao. This game allows young people to playfully discover the ethnography exhibition at the Natural History Museum of La Rochelle, France, and the archaeology exhibition at the Sainte Croix Museum of Poitiers, France. After these experiments, we identified problems regarding dynamic adaptations of the scenario (robot listening time, speech recognition threshold..).

We find that the platform opts for a relatively low regulatory strength when the AI intelligence is relatively small. Interestingly, as generative AI acquires a more extensive knowledge base, the platform and creators may be less willing to adopt it. Moreover, our results show that creators' creativity level experiences a decline compared to the regime with such tools.

Efficient tools for urban design and visualization are essential for city planners and stakeholders to better understand the valuation impact of plans for future sustainable development. Current urban design methods are mainly based on a 2D perspective and lack vertical visualization. Although conventional 3D modeling was introduced to address these limitations, it still has some challenges, such as requiring powerful computing resources and specialized training. Procedural 3D modeling is a grammar-based set of rules that can effectively generate 3D models and enhance spatial visualization when compared with conventional 2D or 3D methods. This paper describes a framework for developing a geodesign tool in Old Town Pocatello, Idaho, USA using procedural modeling to improve planning and visualization for urban design, including (1) Geospatial data preparation in ArcGIS, (2) 3D cityscape model generation in CityEngine, and (3) interactive visualization applications for multiple platforms developed with the Unity game engine. Pocatello is a mid-sized city in southeast Idaho that faces several challenges towards integrating ecosystem services in urban design. As a case study in ecosystem service modelling, we proposed a green scenario for Old Town to demonstrate a tool where permeable surfaces were increased from 37% to 45% to help mitigate urban land surface temperature and improve stormwater management. This geodesign tool offers city planners and stakeholders an opportunity to visualize and analyze block-level scenarios in real time. The interactive applications can encourage public participation in the design process. More ES measurements can be implemented into this tool in the future. The techniques of 3D procedural modeling and ES modeling in this study are also applicable to other small to mid-sized cities worldwide. © 2022 by the authors.","['ecosystem services', 'geodesign', 'GIS', 'impervious surfaces', 'procedural 3D modeling', 'urban design', 'visualization']",MDPI,2073445X (ISSN),English,Land,Article,Scopus,"['Export Date: 06 January 2025; Cited By: 3; Correspondence Address: X.

We construct a generative pipeline that involves condensing narrative context into a compact representation in order to feed to a pretrained language model, which we further fine-tune. We demonstrate that, by maintaining narrative context in the prompt presented to the language model, we can greatly improve over the loss of long-term coherence that still plagues such models. Our story compression technique for representing narrative context uses a handful of freely available natural language processing libraries and models, demonstrating that such interpretive pipelines can be built with limited computational resources and low cost. The resulting tool is capable of producing full-text branching narratives, or of generating individual passages that maintain a high degree of narrative coherence with the prior passages.

Training a generator without a dataset suffers from feedback sparsity, since it is unlikely to generate a playable level via random exploration. A common solution is shaped rewards, which guides the generator to achieve subgoals towards level playability, but they consume effort to design and require game-specific domain knowledge. This paper proposes a novel approach to train generators without datasets or shaped rewards by learning at multiple level sizes starting from small sizes and up to the desired sizes. The denser feedback at small sizes negates the need for shaped rewards. Additionally, the generators learn to build levels at various sizes, including sizes they were not trained for. We apply our approach to train recurrent autoregressive generative flow networks (GFlowNets) for controllable level generation. We also adapt diversity sampling to be compatible with GFlowNets. The results show that our generators create diverse playable levels at various sizes for Sokoban, Zelda, and Danger Dave. When compared with controllable reinforcement learning level generators for Sokoban, the results show that our generators achieve better controllability and competitive diversity, while being 9× faster at training and level generation. © 2023 THE AUTHORS","['Deep learning', 'Generative flow networks', 'Generative models', 'Level generation', 'Procedural content generation', 'Domain Knowledge', 'Learning systems', 'Recurrent neural networks', 'Reinforcement learning', 'Deep learning', 'Flow network', 'Generative flow network', 'Generative model', 'Level generation', 'Playability', 'Procedural content generations', 'Small training', 'Subgoals', 'Training data', 'Feedback']",Elsevier B.V.,11100168 (ISSN),English,Alexandria Engineering Journal,Article,Scopus,['Export Date: 06 January 2025; Cited By: 2'],SCOPUS,,,,

One way to address this would be to approach narrative design in a more abstract layer, such as narrative structures. This paper presents Story Designer, a mixed-initiative co-creative narrative structure tool built on top of the Evolutionary Dungeon Designer (EDD) that uses tropes, narrative conventions found across many media types, to design these structures. Story Designer uses tropes as building blocks for narrative designers to compose complete narrative structures by interconnecting them in graph structures called narrative graphs. Our mixed-initiative approach lets designers manually create their narrative graphs and feeds an underlying evolutionary algorithm with those, creating quality-diverse suggestions using MAP-Elites. Suggestions are visually represented for designers to compare and evaluate and can then be incorporated into the design for further manual editions. At the same time, we use the levels designed within EDD as constraints for the narrative structure, intertwining both level design and narrative. We evaluate the impact of these constraints and the system's adaptability and expressiveness, resulting in a potential tool to create narrative structures combining level design aspects with narrative.  © 2022 Owner/Author.","['Graph Grammars', 'Mixed-Initiative Co-Creativity', 'Narrative Structure', 'Procedural Content Generation', 'Story Generation', 'Context sensitive grammars', 'Graph theory', 'Creatives', 'Encodings', 'Graph grammar', 'Level design', 'Mixed-initiative', 'Mixed-initiative co-creativity', 'Narrative designs', 'Narrative structures', 'Procedural content generations', 'Story generations', 'Formal languages']",Association for Computing Machinery,978-145039795-7 (ISBN),English,ACM Int.

However, designing and conducting effective educational activities with board games requires instructional design skills, knowledge of games, as well as the ability to align the player's internal goals with the learning objectives. Board game-based learning (bGBL) design includes choosing appropriate games and personalising them to better fit with the educational setting and the students' individual needs. This complexity, coupled with a general lack of teacher familiarity with games and game culture, is likely a reason for the relatively low use of board games in formal instructional settings such as schools. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has long been used in education, but the recent diffusion of user-friendly tools for large language models (LLM) opens a new range of possibilities to assist teachers and educators in instructional design: This includes the design and implementation of bGBL. In a preliminary study, we explored the ability of a well-known chatbot, ChatGPT, to select board games and suggest modifications to better align with the classroom context and personal student needs. However, this study was limited to a sample learning unit and was based on a posteriori evaluation by experts. In this contribution, we develop a new testing protocol to assess the reliability, effectiveness, and context sensitivity of several LLMs to adapt given board games to different classroom scenarios. The methodology features blind comparison of AI and human experts. The results suggest that general-purpose AI tools such as Copilot, Claude, and ChatGPT can provide quality and context-sensitive board game modification suggestions, to the point of slightly overperforming human experts in aligning personalisation suggestions to instructional goals. This study represents a first foray in the use of general Artificial Intelligence to assist the modding, or personalisation, of board game-based learning activities and, despite its limitations as a pilot experiment, might pave the way for successful integration of assistive technologies in game-based learning and facilitating its integration in the school curriculum. © 2024 Dechema e.V..

Thus, AI-assisted diagnosis is considered as a possible solution for this issue. Despite the great advances brought by deep learning and especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems are still not used in clinical practice. This may be explained by the dermatologist’s fear of being misled by a false negative and the assimilation of CNNs to a “black box”, making their decision process difficult to understand by a non-expert. Decision theory, especially game theory, is a potential solution as it focuses on identifying the best decision option that maximizes the decision-maker’s expected utility. This study presents a new framework for automated melanoma diagnosis. Pursuing the goal of improving the performance of existing systems, our approach also attempts to bring more transparency in the decision process. The proposed framework includes a multi-class CNN and six binary CNNs assimilated to players. The players’ strategies is to first cluster the pigmented lesions (melanoma, nevus, and benign keratosis), using the introduced method of evaluating the confidence of the predictions, into confidence level (confident, medium, uncertain). Then, a subset of players has the strategy to refine the diagnosis for difficult lesions with medium and uncertain prediction. We used EfficientNetB5 as the backbone of our networks and evaluated our approach on the public ISIC dataset consisting of 8917 lesions: melanoma (1113), nevi (6705) and benign keratosis (1099). The proposed framework achieved an area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) of 0.93 for melanoma, 0.96 for nevus and 0.97 for benign keratosis. Furthermore, our approach outperformed existing methods in this task, improving the balanced accuracy (BACC) of the best compared method from 77% to 86%. These results suggest that our framework provides an effective and explainable decision-making strategy. This approach could help dermatologists in their clinical practice for patients with atypical and difficult-to-diagnose pigmented lesions. We also believe that our system could serve as a didactic tool for less experienced dermatologists. © 2022 by the authors.","['computer aided-diagnosis', 'convolutional neural networks', 'explainability', 'game theory', 'hierarchical architecture', 'melanoma detection', 'XAI', 'Computers', 'Dermoscopy', 'Humans', 'Keratosis', 'Melanoma', 'Neural Networks, Computer', 'Nevus', 'Nevus, Pigmented', 'Skin Diseases', 'Skin Neoplasms', 'adult', 'Article', 'binary classification', 'cancer diagnosis', 'computer assisted diagnosis', 'controlled study', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep neural network', 'dermatologist', 'epiluminescence microscopy', 'false negative result', 'game', 'human', 'keratosis', 'major clinical study', 'melanoma', 'nevus', 'prediction', 'receiver operating characteristic', 'transfer of learning', 'computer', 'diagnostic imaging', 'epiluminescence microscopy', 'keratosis', 'melanoma', 'nevus', 'pathology', 'pigmented nevus', 'procedures', 'skin disease', 'skin tumor']",MDPI,16616596 (ISSN),English,Int.

Player skill influences the viable tactics for different map designs, with some strategies only possible for the best players. Level designers hope to create various maps within the game world that are suited to different strategies, giving players interesting choices when deciding what to do next. This paper proposes using deep learning to measure the connection between player skills and balanced level design. This tool can be added to Unity game engine allowing designers to see the impact of their changes on the level’s design on win-rate probability for different skilled teams. The tool is comprised of a neural network which takes as input the level layout as a stacked 2D one hot encoded array alongside the player parameters, skill rating chosen characters; the neural network output is the win rate probability between 0-1 for team 1.

Raising the level quality is difficult, because it is hard to reason about bugs that can manifest inside generated content. We take the position that debugging requires special attention. We argue that advancing the area of PCG calls for tools and debugging techniques that speed up procedural level design and empower level designers.

Game developers now have never-before-seen possibilities for innovation, immersion, and personalization thanks to GANs, which have become a potent tool for producing realistic data samples across a variety of fields. This review investigates the architecture, training methods, applications, difficulties, and potential future directions of GANs in AI gaming through a thorough analysis of the body of research and publications. The review demonstrates how GANs can transform the game industry by highlighting their many uses in procedural content generation, texture synthesis, character animation, environment design, and content customization. Nevertheless, there are certain difficulties in integrating GANs into AI games, such as computational resources, mode collapse, training instability, and assessment metrics.as well as legal matters. To tackle these obstacles, multidisciplinary research endeavors and cooperation across academic institutions, corporate entities, and regulatory agencies are necessary. Going forward, new avenues for study and developments in GAN technology hold great potential for getting over these roadblocks and opening up fresh possibilities in AI gaming. We can create a future where AI powered gaming experiences change the parameters of interactive entertainment and provide players globally with more engaging, varied, and personalized gaming experiences by utilizing the possibilities of GANs and addressing the related obstacles. © 2024 IEEE.","['Artificial Intelligence (AI)', 'Efficiency', 'Enhancement', 'Gaming', 'Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)', 'Machine Learning', 'Video Games', 'Adversarial machine learning', 'Engineering education', 'Game design', 'Interactive computer graphics', 'Laws and legislation', 'Adversarial networks', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Enhancement', 'Gaming', 'Gaming experiences', 'Generative adversarial network', 'Machine-learning', 'Personalizations', 'Systematic Review', 'Video-games', 'Generative adversarial networks']",Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,979-835038880-0 (ISBN),English,"Int.

Previous studies found that using machine learning techniques in content supplements is vital in adapting the course concepts to the learners' educational level. However, to the best of our knowledge, no research objectively applied machine learning methods to adaptive content generation. This study introduces an adaptive reinforcement learning framework known as RALF through Cellular Learning Automata (CLA) to generate content automatically for students with dyslexia. At first, RALF generates online alphabet models as a simplified font. CLA structure learns each rule of character generation through the reinforcement learning cycle asynchronously. Second, Persian words are generated algorithmically. This process also considers each character's state to decide the alphabet cursiveness and the cells' response to the environment. Finally, RALF can generate long texts and sentences using the embedded word-formation algorithm. The spaces between words are proceeds through the CLA neighboring states. Besides, RALF provides word pronunciation and several exams and games to improve the learning performance of people with dyslexia. The proposed reinforcement learning tool enhances students' learning rate with dyslexia by almost 27% compared to the face-to-face approach. The findings of this research show the applicability of this approach in dyslexia treatment during Lockdown of COVID-19. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","['Educational multimedia', 'Integrated communication', 'Intelligent tutoring system', 'Orthographic knowledge', 'Pandemic crisis', 'Computer aided instruction', 'Curricula', 'Education computing', 'Learning algorithms', 'Reinforcement learning', 'Cellular learning automata', 'Educational levels', 'Educational multimedium', 'Integrated communication', 'Intelligent tutoring', 'Intelligent tutoring system', 'Machine learning techniques', 'Orthographic knowledge', 'Pandemic crisis', 'Tutoring system', 'Students']",Springer,13807501 (ISSN),English,Multimedia Tools Appl,Article,Scopus,"['Export Date: 06 January 2025; Cited By: 27; Correspondence Address: A.

In our approach, the machine learning model automatically generates layout suggestions. The proposed procedural kitchen generation (PKG) model is a pipeline of six Machine Learning (ML) classifiers that are trained and tested on a kitchen layout dataset created by interior designers. The performances of the model are evaluated for the following classifiers: Random forest, Decision tree, AdaBoost, Naive Bayes, MLP, SVM, and L2 Logistic regression. Random forest, as the best performing classifier is used in the final PKG model, and integrated into Unity Engine for automatic 3D kitchen generation and presentation. The PKG model is evaluated in the quantitative and perceptual study, showing better performance than the prior rule-based method.

This article reports new research that followed a design science approach to develop and investigate a co-creative tool called Sport Sparks in one profession – the coaching of professional football players. In response to a coach entering a text description of a coaching challenge (e.g., struggling to maintain the fitness of an athlete) into the tool, the tool automatically generated potentially novel ideas (e.g., reducing game time and changing their nutrition) that the coach could select and/or adapt and evolve into a simple action plan (e.g., which links nutrition to increased game time). This Sport Sparks tool was designed to be an example of human-centred artificial intelligence that aspires to empower humans, to deliver high levels of human control as well as automation, and empower people rather than emulate their expertise. It was engineered with rule-based reasoning to automate the generation of potential new ideas that coaches could select and refine during interactions which provide high user control over this automation. The potential of such a co-creative tool, and value of the guidelines, were demonstrated during the tool's evaluation by coaching practitioners at a Premier League football club. The practitioners used the tool to generate new ideas to coaching challenges, and reported evidence of different forms of creative thinking, although some also reported the need for more support for creative collaborations and solution planning.

Each minute, more than 500 hours worth of videos are uploaded on YouTube. Generating engaging short videos out of the raw captured content is often a time-consuming and cumbersome activity for content creators. Existing ML- based video summarization and highlight generation approaches often neglect the fact that many summarization tasks require specific domain knowledge of the video content, and that human editors often follow a semistructured template when creating the summary (e.g. to create the highlights for a sport event). We therefore address in this paper the challenge of creating domain-specific summaries, by actively leveraging this editorial template. Particularly, we present an Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL)-based framework that can automatically learn the hidden structure or template followed by a human expert when generating a video summary for a specific domain. Particularly, we propose to formulate the video summarization task as a Markov Decision Process, where each state is a combination of the features of the video shots added to the summary, and the possible actions are to include/remove a shot from the summary or leave it as is. Using a set of domain-specific human-generated video highlights as examples, we employ a Maximum Entropy IRL algorithm to learn the implicit reward function governing the summary generation process. The learned reward function is then used to train an RL-agent that can produce video summaries for a specific domain, closely resembling what a human expert would create. Learning from expert demonstrations allows our approach to be applicable to any domain or editorial styles. To demonstrate the superior performance of our approach, we employ it to the task of soccer games highlight generation and show that it outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, both quantitatively and qualitatively.  © 2020 IEEE.","['Inverse Reinforcement Learning', 'Video summarization', 'Inverse problems', 'Markov processes', 'Natural language processing systems', 'Sports', 'Video recording', 'Content creators', 'Domain knowledge', 'Hidden structures', 'Inverse reinforcement learning', 'Markov Decision Processes', 'State-of-the-art methods', 'Summary generation', 'Video summarization', 'Reinforcement learning']",Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,978-172818697-9 (ISBN),English,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

Respecting designer control is about creating a tool that gives enough control to bring out the designer's vision. Respecting the creative process concerns itself with having a feedback loop that is short enough, that the creative process is not disturbed. Respecting existing work processes means that a PCG tool should plug in easily to existing asset pipelines.

Manually creating virtual NWs (e.g. for games and films) requires considerable creative and technical skills, in addition to a deep understanding of the story in question. Procedural generation methods, in turn, generally lack in creativity and have a hard time coping with the numerous degrees of freedom left open by a story. In contrast, mixed-initiative approaches offer a promising path to solve this tension. We propose a mixed-initiative approach assisting an NW designer in choosing plausible entities for the locations, where the story takes place. Our approach is based on a recommender method that uses common and novel associations to narrative locations, actions and entities. Our method builds upon a large dataset of co-occurrences of disambiguated terms that we retrieved from photo captions. Building on this knowledge, our solution deploys entity (un)relatedness, offers clusters of semantically and contextually related entities, and highlights novelty of recommended content, thus effectively supporting the designer’s creative task, while helping to stay consistent with the story. We demonstrate our method via an interactive prototype called roleTaleForge. Designers can obtain meaningful entity suggestions for their NWs, which enables guided exploration, while preserving creative freedom. We present an example of the interactive workflow of our method, and illustrate its usefulness. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","['Authoring tool', 'Mixed initiative', 'Narrative world', 'Recommender method', 'Synset vectors', 'Degrees of freedom (mechanics)', 'Recommender systems', 'Authoring tool', 'Creative skills', 'Creatives', 'Generation method', 'Mixed-initiative', 'Narrative world', 'Recommende method', 'Synset vector', 'Synsets', 'Technical skills', 'Large dataset']",Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,03029743 (ISSN); 978-303092299-3 (ISBN),English,Lect.

However, creating tile maps entirely by hand can be tedious, especially for large maps or across several map generation tasks. There is potential for generative systems to support users in more efficiently and enjoyably creating tile maps, but a more streamlined content generation experience often comes at the cost of reduced control over the generated content. In this paper, we present a mixed-initiative map generation tool that supports users in creating customized tile maps by providing complete control over both the map being generated and the rules governing an underlying Answer Set Programming-based generator. Using a small palette of rules designed for tile map generation, users define constraints on the types of maps the system will generate, view and edit generated maps, and selectively re-generate sections of the map until they are satisfied. We discuss our current progress on this tool and present several opportunities for future work, with a particular focus on expanding the capabilities for authoring rule-based tile map generators.

For near-term applications, quantum software needs to be carefully tailored to the hardware available. In this paper, we begin to explore whether near-term quantum computers could provide tools that are useful in the creation and implementation of computer games. The procedural generation of geopolitical maps and their associated history is considered as a motivating example. This is performed by encoding a rudimentary decision making process for the nations within a quantum procedure that is well-suited to near-term devices.

The surrogate model combines level and ruleset elements as input and gameplay outcomes as output, thus constructing a mapping between three different facets of games. Using this model as a surrogate for expensive gameplay simulations, a search-based generator can adapt content toward a target gameplay outcome. Using a shooter game as the target domain, this paper explores how parameters of the players' character classes can be mapped to both the level's representation and the gameplay outcomes of balance and match duration. The surrogate model is built on a deep learning architecture, trained on a large corpus of randomly generated sets of levels, classes, and simulations from game playing agents. Results show that a search-based generative approach can adapt character classes, levels, or both toward designer-specified targets. The model can thus act as a design assistant or be integrated in a mixed-initiative tool. Most importantly, the combination of three game facets into the model allows it to identify the synergies between levels, rules, and gameplay and orchestrate the generation of the former two toward desired outcomes.  © 2018 IEEE.","['Deep learning', 'procedural content generation (PCG)', 'search-based PCG', 'shooter games', 'surrogate model', 'Game playing', 'Large corpora', 'Learning architectures', 'Mixed initiative', 'Procedural content generations', 'Search-based', 'Surrogate model', 'Target domain', 'Deep learning']",Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,24751502 (ISSN),English,IEEE Trans.

For instance, in pediatric healthcare, it is important to help children to feel comfortable during medical procedures and tests that may be performed on them. To tackle such an issue with the help of AR-based solutions, this article presents the design, implementation and evaluation of a novel open-source collaborative framework that enables to develop teaching, training, and monitoring pediatric healthcare applications. Specifically, such a framework allows for building collaborative applications and shared experiences for AR devices, providing functionalities for connecting with other AR devices and enabling real-time visualization and simultaneous interaction with virtual objects. Since all the communications involved in AR interactions are handled by AR devices, the proposed collaborative framework is able to operate autonomously through a Local Area Network (LAN), thus requiring no cloud or external servers. In order to demonstrate the potential of the proposed framework, a practical use case application is presented. Such an application has been designed to motivate pediatric patients and to encourage them to increase their physical activity through AR games. The presented games do not require any previous configuration, as they use ARCore automatic surface detection technology. Moreover, the AR mobile gaming framework allows multiple players to engage in the same AR experience, so children can interact and collaborate among them sharing the same AR content. In addition, the proposed AR system provides a remote web application that is able to collect and to visualize data on patient use, aiming to provide healthcare professionals with qualified data about the mobility and mood of their patients through an intuitive and user-friendly web tool. Finally, to determine the performance of the proposed AR system, this article presents its evaluation in terms of latency and processing time. The results show that both times are low enough to provide a good user experience. © 2021 by the authors.

Testing games is a difficult task requiring a lot of manual effort since the interaction space in the game is very fine grained and requires a certain level of intelligence that cannot be easily automated. This makes testing a costly activity in the overall development of games. This paper presents a model-based formulation of game play testing in such a way that search-based testing can be applied for test generation. An abstraction of the desired game behaviour is captured in an extended finite state machine (EFSM) and search-based algorithms are used to derive abstract tests from the model, which are then concretised into action sequences that are executed on the game under test. The approach is implemented in a prototype tool EvoMBT. We carried out experiments on a 3D game to assess the suitability of the approach in general, and search-based test generation in particular. We applied 5 search algorithms for test generation on three different models of the game. Results show that search algorithms are able to achieve reasonable coverage on models: between 75% and 100% for the small and medium sized models, and between 29% and 56% for the bigger model. Mutation analysis shows that on the actual game application tests kill up to 99% of mutants. Tests have also revealed previously unknown faults. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","['Game play testing', 'Model-based testing', 'Search-based testing', 'Computer games', 'Learning algorithms', 'Software testing', 'Testing', 'Game play testing', 'Game plays', 'Game technologies', 'Model based approach', 'Model based testing', 'Play testing', 'Search Algorithms', 'Search-based', 'Search-based testing', 'Test generations', 'Model checking']",Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,03029743 (ISSN); 978-303088105-4 (ISBN),English,Lect.

To overcome such problems, machine learning can be used to map important patterns of a game design and apply them in the PCG.

As a result, many existing game generators are good at producing games that contain novel and surprising combinations of mechanics, but bad at generating games that are readily interpretable by players as cultural artifacts. To address this problem, we introduce the concept of a genre-specific game description language (GSGDL): a game description language that deliberately encodes assumptions about a particular genre of games as a cultural form. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the use of an internal representation of game structure used by the game creation tool GB Studio as a GSGDL for top-down 2D roleplaying games targeting the Game Boy. The use of this GSGDL gives us leverage to rapidly iterate on game generation features targeting a specific game genre and platform; to work with an existing toolchain that offers graphical editing, code generation, and automated play testing; and to more readily generate games that are interpretable by players as examples of a particular cultural form. © 2021 IEEE.","['Interactive computer graphics', 'Codegeneration', 'Cultural artifacts', 'Description languages', 'Game Boy', 'Internal representation', 'Play testing', 'Proof of concept', 'Role-playing game', 'Topdown', 'Mechanics']",IEEE Computer Society,23254270 (ISSN); 978-166543886-5 (ISBN),English,"IEEE Conf.

A branch of QD uses genetic operators to generate content (e.g. MAP-Elites). Problematically, levels generated with these operators have no guarantee of matching the style of a game. This can be addressed by incorporating whether a level is generable by an n-gram into the fitness function. Unfortunately, this leads to wasted computation and poor results. In this work, we introduce n-gram genetic operators, which produce only solutions that are generable by the n-gram model; we call MAP-Elites combined with these operators Gram-Elites. We test on a tile-based side-scrolling platformer, vertical platformer, and roguelike. For all three, n-gram operators outperform standard operators and random n-gram generation, finding more usable (i.e. completable and generable) solutions at a faster rate. By integrating structure into operators, instead of fitness, these genetic operators could be beneficial to QD in PCGML.  © 2021 ACM.","['genetic operators', 'n-grams', 'procedural content generation', 'quality-diversity', 'video games', 'Computer games', 'Human computer interaction', 'Interactive computer graphics', 'Fitness functions', 'Game contents', 'Genetic operators', 'Matchings', 'N-gram modeling', 'N-gram models', 'N-grams', 'Procedural content generations', 'Quality-diversity', 'Video-games', 'Machine learning']",Association for Computing Machinery,978-145038422-3 (ISBN),English,ACM Int.

The taxonomy represents the hierarchical structure of the software tools and in each category, there is a certain set of tools. The focus of this paper is on the development of a functional model of the instrument Maze Game Designer, based on the application of the TIMED-VGE taxonomy. The Maze Game Designer is in the category ""Design management""instruments, according to the taxonomy. The tool is key to starting the process of designing and creating educational games in the APOGECrossed D sign• platform.

This new paradigm empowers demand-side agents to play a more active role through coordinating, cooperating, and negotiating with other agents. Nevertheless, most of these agents are not used to process market signals and develop optimal strategies, especially in the residential sector. Accordingly, it is indispensable to create tools that automate and facilitate demand-side participation in TE systems. This paper presents a new methodology for residential automated agents to perform two key tasks: prevision and planning. Specifically, the proposed method is applied to a forward market where agents' planning is a fundamental step to maintain the dynamic balance between demand and generation. Since planning depends on future demand, agents' prevision of consumption is an inevitable part of this step. The procedures for automating the targeted tasks are developed in a general way for residential prosumers and consumers, interacting at the distribution level. These players are managed by a demand aggregator as the leader by means of the Stackelberg game. The suggested process results in a TE setup for multi-stage single-side auctions, useful to manage future Smart Energy Markets. Through simulated transactions, this paper examines the market clearing mechanism and the convenience of agents' planning. The results show that customers with higher price-elasticity leverage lower costs periods. However, they make it harder to reduce the peak-to-average ratio of the aggregated demand profile since a unique price signal can create prisoner's dilemma conditions. © 2021 The Author(s)","['Agents interaction', 'Forward market', 'Multi-agent system', 'Price-elasticity', 'Prosumer', 'Smart energy markets', 'Stackelberg game', 'Transactive energy', 'Utility function', 'Elasticity', 'Housing', 'Power markets', 'Agent interaction', 'Energy', 'Energy markets', 'Forward market', 'Price-elasticity', 'Prosumer', 'Smart energies', 'Smart energy market', 'Stackelberg Games', 'Transactive energy', 'Utility functions', 'Multi agent systems']",Elsevier Ltd,26669552 (ISSN),English,Smart Energy,Article,Scopus,"['Export Date: 06 January 2025; Cited By: 19; Correspondence Address: D.

Terrain generation through multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) is investigated, and it is deemed the usage was restricted to the gaming domain and not extended to other fields. Findings suggest that the correctness of generated terrain is a big issue in the automatic generation of terrains. Thus, a focus on the automated correctness check is required. Other important content generation in video games such as structure generation and character generation has been extensively studied, and the techniques are analysed in the further sections of this research work.  © 2022 Abdul Latif et al.","['Genetic algorithms', 'Landforms', 'Virtual reality', 'Building blockes', 'Critical evaluation', 'Digital world', 'Know-that', 'Map planning', 'Procedural content generations', 'Real- time', 'Terrain generations', 'Urban and rural', 'Virtual worlds', 'Engines']",Hindawi Limited,1687725X (ISSN),English,J.

T. S. Zongolica, Zongolica, Mexico","A software development process comprises all the steps necessary to produce a software product. This research proposes a new process for developing augmented reality serious games (ARSGs), which comprises three phases: analysis, configuration, and generation. The analysis phase involves examining the standard project structure of a typical serious game to identify the applicable actions to which AR content can be added. The configuration phase involves configuring the AR features and the AR library to be integrated into the game structure. Finally, the generation phase entails inserting the AR code in the game structure, as well as all the files necessary to in-corporate AR features in the game. Our process allows generating ARSGs step by step, both easily and rapidly. To implement this process, we propose an ARSG development software architecture. The underlying assumption of this architecture is that software development tools are essential validation elements of the software generation process. By implementing our ARSG development process through a software architecture, we provide users with a formal, automated method for creating ARSGs. The ARSG development process and the architecture, collectively called ZeusAR, are not dependent on specific software development technologies and/or programming languages. To perform a proof-of-concept of our process, we developed an ARSG generator tool based on the proposed architecture and conducted a case study in which geometry ARSGs are developed to help high school students learn about geometric shapes and their properties. We conducted a qualitative evaluation of the ZeusAR tool through a System-Usability-Scale (SUS) based survey, which was administered to a group of geometry teachers to evaluate the tool’s characteristics, such as ease of use and ease of configuration. Additionally, a group of software developers and professors assessed the performance of the ZeusAR tool in terms of game development time. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","['Augmented reality serious game', 'Software process', 'Geometry', 'Serious games', 'Software architecture', 'Software design', 'Augmented reality serious game', 'Development process', 'Phase analysis', 'Phase configurations', 'Serious game development', 'Software development process', 'Software process', 'Software products', 'Three phase', 'Three phasis', 'Augmented reality']",Springer,13807501 (ISSN),English,Multimedia Tools Appl,Article,Scopus,"['Export Date: 06 January 2025; Cited By: 9; Correspondence Address: G.

It comprises a multiplayer game with asymmetric interaction in which a player must reach the exit of a maze within a time limit, while wearing a head mounted display. The maze is complex and the player could not reach the exit on time without a team there to help her using a large number of printed maps describing candidate mazes. The player describes what she sees to the team who use such information to identify which one of the several available maps the player is currently navigating in virtual reality. Each game requires the generation of hundreds of very similar maps with several aliasing (confusing) situations but at the same time need to have a solution to guarantee that if the team members collaborate effectively they can guide the player to the exit. It would be infeasible for a human designer to provide such a massive number of maps for every game played. Accordingly, we developed automatic authoring tools to help designers generate such large sets of maps and also to optimize them based on design principles focusing on fun and pace. Our preliminary results show that the authoring pipeline we created can generate games (set of maps) adherent to such design principles.  © 2020 IEEE.","['collaborative puzzle games', 'Search-based procedural content generation', 'team building', 'Intelligent computing', 'Asymmetric interaction', 'Automatic authoring', 'Collaborative games', 'Design Principles', 'Head mounted displays', 'Multiplayer games', 'Procedural content generations', 'Team building', 'Helmet mounted displays']",Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,978-172812547-3 (ISBN),English,"IEEE Symp.

This article examines a sample of eight newsgame designs and the mechanisms through which they transmit information on issues related to political activity. We designed a qualitative analysis tool to examine the journalistic and gaming quality of the newsgames by analysing 28 parameters in four categories: formal parameters, content parameters, quality of use and architecture and design. Our results show that the use of playful elements is compatible with the fulfilment of journalistic quality standards and the choice of mechanics and dynamics determines how the user perceives and interacts with the information. However, the balance between both aspects does not guarantee that a newsgame provides the narrative resources to understand the information autonomously. Thus, newsgames are a genre with great journalistic potential when using the correct choice of mechanics and dynamics that allows communicating information according to news standards. © The Author(s) 2020.","['Game design', 'game mechanics', 'journalism', 'newsgames', 'political news', 'procedural rhetoric', 'quality']",SAGE Publications Ltd,13548565 (ISSN),English,Convergence,Article,Scopus,"['Export Date: 06 January 2025; Cited By: 11; Correspondence Address: A.

We use machine learning to create a surrogate model that maps film ratings from tropes, trained with the data extracted and processed from huge film databases in Internet, and then we use a genetic algorithm that uses that surrogate model as evaluator to optimize the combination of tropes in a film.

The automatic generation of quests and objectives is an interesting challenge since this can extend the lifetime of games such as in Skyrim, or can help create unique experiences such as in AI Dungeon. This work presents Questgram [Qg], a mixed-initiative prototype tool for creating quests using grammars combined in a mixed-initiative level design tool. We evaluated our tool quantitatively by assessing the generated quests and qualitatively through a small user study. Human designers evaluated the system by creating quests manually, automatically, and through mixed-initiative. Our results show the Questgram's potential, which creates diverse, valid, and interesting quests using quest patterns. Likewise, it helps engage designers in the quest design process, fosters their creativity by inspiring them, and enhance the level generation facet of the Evolutionary Dungeon Designer with steps towards intertwining both level and quest design.  © 2021 ACM.","['Grammars', 'Mixed-Initiative Co-Creativity', 'Procedural Content Generation', 'Quest Generation', 'Adventure games', 'Core elements', 'Gameplay', 'Generation tools', 'Grammar', 'Mixed-initiative', 'Mixed-initiative co-creativity', 'Procedural content generations', 'Quest generation', 'Role-playing game']",Association for Computing Machinery,978-145038422-3 (ISBN),English,ACM Int.

However, their applications are hampered by many issues, including high development costs. Procedural content generation (PCG) and medium coupling are two potent methods for reducing an educational game's development cost; however, their joint application is under-studied. In this study, we explored the topic through a PCG application for generating placements of objects representing elements of learning content in a game map. The content consisted of correct answers, which the player must gather in the correct order, and wrong answers, which the player must avoid. We employed an evolutionary algorithm in three stages of the generation: it first generated a minimal set of correct answer element objects (CAEOs), followed by generating a copy of the set, and then a set of wrong answer element objects (WAEOs). We employed and tested a fitness function that calculated the mean and standard deviation of object pair distances. The results show that the generation algorithm is capable of generating CAEOs and WAEOs distributions that are unpredictable and encourage exploration. We find that multiplying the fitness function's standard deviation variable by a specific value, which depends on how many objects are to be generated, is crucial to the algorithm's success. We also discuss the limitations of this study and directions for future ones.  © 2020 IEEE.","['educational games', 'evolutionary algorithm.', 'medium coupling', 'object placements', 'procedural content generation', 'Facsimile', 'Statistics', 'Development costs', 'Fitness functions', 'Generation algorithm', 'Learning contents', 'Mean and standard deviations', 'Object placement', 'Procedural content generations', 'Standard deviation', 'Evolutionary algorithms']",Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,978-172819673-2 (ISBN),English,"Int.

The proposal is portable and extensible, and allows games to not only be defined at engine level but also includes specific features that can lead the game design process whilst simultaneously reducing the gap between game specification and its corresponding game implementation. XVGDL is as generic as possible, making it possible to describe different genres of games. This paper focuses on presenting the basis of the language. The paper describes the syntax as well as the components of XVGDL, and provides examples of their use. Defining games via XML structures provides all the advantages of the management of XML files and opens up interesting lines of research. Our proposal provides a number of novel features. So, XVGDL game definitions can be managed as any other XML file, which means that it can be automatically handled by any XML file management software. Another interesting feature is that XVGDL can specify game components (e.g., game Artificial), in-game processes (e.g., the procedural generation of maps) or in-game events (e.g., the checking of the conditions to end a game match) via the association with external (possibly non-XML) files. Moreover, XVGDL files can be easily validated as any XML file what means that validations against a particular Document Type Definition (DTD) or XML Schema Definition (XSD) are possible. In addition, the paper presents a first prototype implementation of a (text-based) interpreter that allows XVGDL game specifications as a playable game to be executed. This tool not only validates our proposal but also represents a first step towards smoothing the path to obtaining an executable version of a game from its game specification. © 2013 IEEE.","['extensible markup language', 'game design', 'game tools', 'Video game description language', 'XML', 'Hypertext systems', 'Interactive computer graphics', 'Specifications', 'XML', 'Description languages', 'Document type definition', 'Extensible Mark-Up language (XML)', 'Game design', 'Game specifications', 'Prototype implementations', 'Xml schema definitions', 'Xml structures', 'Human computer interaction']",Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,21693536 (ISSN),English,IEEE Access,Article,Scopus,"['Export Date: 06 January 2025; Cited By: 4; Correspondence Address: A.J.

It affects the patient in life’s major areas, such as work, interpersonal relationships, or self-care, and the usual treatment is performed with the help of anti-psychotic medication, which targets primarily the hallucinations, delirium, etc. Other symptoms, such as the decreased emotional expression or avolition, require a multidisciplinary approach, including psychopharmacology, cognitive training, and many forms of therapy. In this context, this paper addresses the use of digital technologies to design and develop innovative rehabilitation techniques, particularly focusing on mental health rehabilitation, and contributing for the promotion of well-being and health from a holistic perspective. In this context, serious games and virtual reality allows for creation of immersive environments that contribute to a more effective and lasting recovery, with improvements in terms of quality of life. The use of machine learning techniques will allow the real-time analysis of the data collected during the execution of the rehabilitation procedures, as well as enable their dynamic and automatic adaptation according to the profile and performance of the patients, by increasing or reducing the exercises’ difficulty. It relies on the acquisition of biometric and physiological signals, such as voice, heart rate, and game performance, to estimate the stress level, thus adapting the difficulty of the experience to the skills of the patient. The system described in this paper is currently in development, in collaboration with a health unit, and is an engineering effort that combines hardware and software to develop a rehabilitation tool for schizophrenic patients. A clinical trial is also planned for assessing the effectiveness of the system among negative symptoms in schizophrenia patients. © 2021 by the authors.

The horror features found in the ludology are separated into a distinct hierarchy: low-level features and high-level features. These features are used in conjunction with a procedurally generated tilemap to create an annotated map denoting candidate locations for strong horror moments. This system is evaluated using a series of pathfinding agents which score the annotated tilemap.
