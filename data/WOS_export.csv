The surrogate model combines level and ruleset elements as input and gameplay outcomes as output, thus constructing a mapping between three different facets of games. Using this model as a surrogate for expensive gameplay simulations, a search-based generator can adapt content toward a target gameplay outcome. Using a shooter game as the target domain, this paper explores how parameters of the players' character classes can be mapped to both the level's representation and the gameplay outcomes of balance and match duration. The surrogate model is built on a deep learning architecture, trained on a large corpus of randomly generated sets of levels, classes, and simulations from game playing agents. Results show that a search-based generative approach can adapt character classes, levels, or both toward designer-specified targets. The model can thus act as a design assistant or be integrated in a mixed-initiative tool. Most importantly, the combination of three game facets into the model allows it to identify the synergies between levels, rules, and gameplay and orchestrate the generation of the former two toward desired outcomes.","Univ Malta, Inst Digital Games, Msida 2080, Malta",University of Malta,"defaultdict(<class 'list'>, {'FU': [""European Union's Horizon 2020 program [787476]""], 'FX': [""This work was supported by the European Union's Horizon 2020 program under Grant 787476.""], 'PU': ['IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC'], 'PI': ['PISCATAWAY'], 'PA': ['445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA'], 'J9': ['IEEE T GAMES'], 'JI': ['IEEE Trans.

Hence, we have developed a Unity plugin to graphically represent a building layout using nodes and edges for rooms and doors that also allow defining the size and aspect ratio of spaces. This abstract representation is then automatically converted into a blueprint and optimized for explicit constraints (doors, size, and ratio) and implicit ones (tightness, convexity) by applying stochastic hill-climbing or steepest ascent hill-climbing algorithms. Then, the user can edit that blueprint further. As a final result, the tool generates a navigable 3D representation of the floor plan for the user to explore and go back to edit it if necessary.

PCG refers to techniques for creating game content algorithmically, by manipulating data through sets of computational operations and parameters. By producing scalable results with combinatorial diversity, procedural generation is touted as the future of content, yet flouted as the harbinger of technological unemployment in game art production. Critical scholarship on automation suggests that the real danger is not job loss per se, but the constitution of an underclass of artists whose vital work of conditioning algorithmic outputs is denigrated as derivative and 'manual'. Framed by liberal humanist ideas of agency, PCG naturalizes trade-offs where the autonomy of generative machines is contingent upon the automatism of its human conditioners. This qualitative analyses of talks on PCG at the Game Developers Conference (2015-2020) shows how procedural systems bifurcate the creative work of algorithmic cultural production into affective and mechanical forms of conditioning that map onto stratifications of racial capitalism. Affective tuning resists documentation and is reserved for artists with technomasculine forms of cultural capital; mechanical tuning is relegated to automatable and outsourced labour and relies on replicable technique that is considered artistic but not creative. This article argues that PCG's reclassification of creativity through racialised dialectics of human agency and machine automaticity overlooks the autonomy of procedural systems. PCG pipelines are organised less around the agency of human toolmakers and more around the autonomy of systems that assimilate tasks in the management of complex networks of dependencies. Instead of pitting artists against machines, this analysis politicises automation's racial stratifications by examining the momentum of more-than-human systems in which toolmakers and tool users negotiate granularities of control and degrees of concession.","Goldsmiths Univ London, Media Commun & Cultural Studies, London, England",University of London,"defaultdict(<class 'list'>, {'PU': ['SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC'], 'PI': ['THOUSAND OAKS'], 'PA': ['2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA'], 'J9': ['CONVERGENCE-US'], 'JI': ['Convergence'], 'WE': ['Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)']})",1354-8565,APR,2022,28,2,389,412,10.1177/13548565221076434,WOS:000763580000001,"['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  11', 'Total Times Cited:  11', 'Cited Reference Count:  68']",WOS,13548565221076434,FEB 2022,

An area in which progress has been comparatively slow is the development of generalisable approaches for comparing alternative PCG systems, especially in terms of their generative spaces. It is to this area that this paper aims to make a contribution, by exploring the utility of data compression algorithms in compressing the generative spaces of PCG systems. We hope that this approach could be the basis for developing useful qualitative tools for comparing PCG systems to help designers better understand and optimize their generators. In this work we assess the efficacy of a selection of algorithms across sets of levels for 2D tile-based games by investigating how much their respective generative space compressions correlate with level behavioral characteristics. We conclude that the approach looks to be a promising one despite some inconsistency in efficacy in alternative domains, and that of the algorithms tested Multiple Correspondence Analysis appears to perform the most effectively.","Queen Mary Univ London, London, England",University of London,"defaultdict(<class 'list'>, {'CP': ['IEEE Conference on Games (CoG)'], 'FU': ['EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Intelligent Games & Games Intelligence (IGGI) [EP/S022325/1]'], 'FX': ['This work was supported by the EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Intelligent Games & Games Intelligence (IGGI) [EP/S022325/1].

This study provides and in-depth review of the different tools, algorithms, and engines used for the PCG of terrains for the PCG of digital worlds; we focus especially on terrain generation but address also the main issues related to build structures and characters. It is important to know that the PCG of terrains can be implemented in a multidisciplinary scenario, for instance, modeling of games, simulating industrial maps, urban and rural planning of developments, government, and nongovernmental agency improvement plans. Many problems in current approaches were identified from the literature, where most of the researches studied were merely throwaway prototyping based, i.e., proof of concept-based systems, and were not tested in the real environment. Also, genetic algorithm-based PCG of terrains lack multiple features such as roads and buildings. The virtual cities generated through different engines were lacking a realistic look and feel. Terrain generation through multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) is investigated, and it is deemed the usage was restricted to the gaming domain and not extended to other fields. Findings suggest that the correctness of generated terrain is a big issue in the automatic generation of terrains. Thus, a focus on the automated correctness check is required.

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) enable the generation of game behaviors based on player input at runtime. Such code generation brings with it the possibility of entirely new gameplay interactions that may be difficult to integrate with typical game development workflows. We explore these implications through GROMIT, a novel LLM-based runtime behavior generation system for Unity. When triggered by a player action, GROMIT generates a relevant behavior which is compiled without developer intervention and incorporated into the game. We create three demonstration scenarios with GROMIT to investigate how such a technology might be used in game development. In a system evaluation we find that our implementation is able to produce behaviors that result in significant downstream impacts to gameplay. We then conduct an interview study with n=13 game developers using GROMIT as a probe to elicit their current opinion on runtime behavior generation tools, and enumerate the specific themes curtailing the wider use of such tools. We find that the main themes of concern are quality considerations, community expectations, and fit with developer workflows, and that several of the subthemes are unique to runtime behavior generation specifically. We outline a future work agenda to address these concerns, including the need for additional guardrail systems for behavior generation.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System,"defaultdict(<class 'list'>, {'CP': ['37th ACM Annual Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology (UIST)'], 'PU': ['ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY'], 'PI': ['NEW YORK'], 'PA': ['1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES'], 'WE': ['Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)']})",979-8-4007-0628-8,,2024,,,,,10.1145/3654777.3676358,WOS:001336570000036,"['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0', 'Total Times Cited:  0', 'Cited Reference Count:  33']",WOS,106,,['ACM']

Then, we present an architecture of deep generative models that takes as input an image of a character in one domain (pose) and transfers it to another. We approach the problem using generative adversarial networks (GANs) and build on Pix2Pix's architecture while leveraging some specific characteristics of the pixel art style. We evaluated the trained models using four small datasets (less than 1k) and a more extensive and diverse one (12k). The models yielded promising results, and their generalization capacity varies according to the dataset size and variability. After training models to generate images among four domains (i.e., front, right, back, left), we present an early version of a mixed-initiative sprite editor that allows users to interact with them and iterate in creating character sprites.","Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Dept Ciencia Comp, Belo Horizonte, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais,"defaultdict(<class 'list'>, {'FU': ['CAPES [001]; CNPq [311900/2020-8]; Fapemig [PPM -00563-18]'], 'FX': ['This work was partially supported by CAPES (finance code 001) , CNPq (grant 311900/2020-8) and Fapemig (grant PPM -00563-18) .'], 'PU': ['ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE'], 'PI': ['SAN DIEGO'], 'PA': ['525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA'], 'J9': ['GRAPH MODELS'], 'JI': ['Graph.

In contrast, mixed-initiative approaches offer a promising path to solve this tension. We propose a mixed-initiative approach assisting an NW designer in choosing plausible entities for the locations, where the story takes place. Our approach is based on a recommender method that uses common and novel associations to narrative locations, actions and entities. Our method builds upon a large dataset of co-occurrences of disambiguated terms that we retrieved from photo captions. Building on this knowledge, our solution deploys entity (un)relatedness, offers clusters of semantically and contextually related entities, and highlights novelty of recommended content, thus effectively supporting the designer's creative task, while helping to stay consistent with the story. We demonstrate our method via an interactive prototype called TaleForge. Designers can obtain meaningful entity suggestions for their NWs, which enables guided exploration, while preserving creative freedom.

This paper proposes using deep learning to measure the connection between player skills and balanced level design. This tool can be added to Unity game engine allowing designers to see the impact of their changes on the level's design on win-rate probability for different skilled teams. The tool is comprised of a neural network which takes as input the level layout as a stacked 2D one hot encoded array alongside the player parameters, skill rating chosen characters; the neural network output is the win rate probability between 0-1 for team 1. Data for this neural network is generated using learning agents that are learning the game using self-play (Silver et al., 2017) and the level data that is used for training the neural network is generated using procedural content generation (PCG) techniques.","Univ Limerick, Limerick, Ireland",University of Limerick,"defaultdict(<class 'list'>, {'ED': ['Rocha, AP', 'Steels, L', 'VandenHerik, J'], 'CP': ['14th International Conference on Agents and Artificial Intelligence (ICAART)'], 'FU': ['Lero: The Irish Software Research Centre'], 'FX': ['We would like to thank Lero: The Irish Software Research Centre for their continued help and support.'], 'PU': ['SCITEPRESS'], 'PI': ['SETUBAL'], 'PA': ['AV D MANUELL, 27A 2 ESQ, SETUBAL, 2910-595, PORTUGAL'], 'J9': ['ICAART'], 'WE': ['Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)']})",2184-433X,,2022,,,827,833,10.5220/0010914200003116,WOS:000774776400101,"['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1', 'Total Times Cited:  1', 'Cited Reference Count:  15']",WOS,,,

It comprises a multiplayer game with asymmetric interaction in which a player must reach the exit of a maze within a time limit, while wearing a head mounted display. The maze is complex and the player could not reach the exit on time without a team there to help her using a large number of printed maps describing candidate mazes. The player describes what she sees to the team who use such information to identify which one of the several available maps the player is currently navigating in virtual reality. Each game requires the generation of hundreds of very similar maps with several aliasing (confusing) situations but at the same lime need to have a solution to guarantee that if the team members collaborate effectively they can guide the player to the exit. It would be infeasible for a human designer to provide such a massive number of maps for every game played. Accordingly, we developed automatic authoring tools to help designers generate such large sets of maps and also to optimize them based on design principles focusing on fun and pace.

This can be addressed by incorporating whether a level is generable by an n-gram into the fitness function. Unfortunately, this leads to wasted computation and poor results. In this work, we introduce n-gram genetic operators, which produce only solutions that are generable by the n-gram model; we call MAP-Elites combined with these operators Gram-Elites. We test on a tile-based side-scrolling platformer, vertical platformer, and roguelike. For all three, n-gram operators outperform standard operators and random n-gram generation, finding more usable (i.e. completable and generable) solutions at a faster rate.

By comparing the calculated similarity against expected similarity distribution obtained from face-to-face games among professional Go players, we obtained the probability that a game record is solely the result of a human play unaided by any AI tools. Rather than simply estimating the AI-likeness rate of a play, we provide a numerical basis for AI-assisted cheating by calculating the probability that a certain value of AI-likeness rate will occur in a professional game. We apply our method to a recent alleged game of AI-assisted cheating, and find that the AI-likeness rate is quite high and the chance of happening is as low as one in 1,000,000 games, if it were played by a professional player.","Hanyang Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Seoul 04763, South Korea",Hanyang University,"defaultdict(<class 'list'>, {'FU': ['Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science and ICT [NRF2017R1E1A1A01077717, NRF-2018R1D1A1B07049312]'], 'FX': ['This research was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT (NRF2017R1E1A1A01077717 and NRF-2018R1D1A1B07049312).

As one of the greatest issues plaguing modern shooters, aim assist (also referred to as aimbots) greatly increase the speed and accuracy of cheating players, giving them an unfair advantage over their competitors. The latest versions of these aim assisting tools make use of object detection models such as YOLO (You Only Look Once); fortunately, these models are vulnerable to attack via small perturbations to their input space which results in the misclassification of objects. The purpose of this work is to formulate an attack on a black-box object detection model which can be feasibly implemented in a commercial game environment. What makes our solution unique is the generation of attack images in the form of in-game objects rendered by the game engine itself, instead of a set of screenshots or from a generic differentiable renderer. Results show that our approach is capable of generating adversarial examples which can fool an object detection model in a blackbox environment, as well as recreating the game's original textures such that these perturbations go unnoticed by players.","Univ Western Ontario, Dept Comp Sci, London, ON, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario),"defaultdict(<class 'list'>, {'ED': ['Ciancarini, P', 'DiIorio , A', 'Hlavacs, H', 'Poggi, F'], 'CP': ['22nd IFIP TC 14 International Conference on Entertainment Computing (ICEC)'], 'PU': ['SPRINGER-VERLAG SINGAPORE PTE LTD'], 'PI': ['SINGAPORE'], 'PA': ['152 BEACH ROAD, #21-01/04 GATEWAY EAST, SINGAPORE, 189721, SINGAPORE'], 'J9': ['LECT NOTES COMPUT SC'], 'WE': ['Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)']})",0302-9743,,2023,14455,,290,305,10.1007/978-981-99-8248-6_24,WOS:001160614300024,"['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0', 'Total Times Cited:  0', 'Cited Reference Count:  22']",WOS,,,

As a result, many existing game generators are good at producing games that contain novel and surprising combinations of mechanics, but bad at generating games that are readily interpretable by players as cultural artifacts. To address this problem, we introduce the concept of a genre-specific game description language (GSGDL): a game description language that deliberately encodes assumptions about a particular genre of games as a cultural form. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the use of an internal representation of game structure used by the game creation tool GB Studio as a GSGDL for top-down 2D roleplaying games targeting the Game Boy. The use of this GSGDL gives us leverage to rapidly iterate on game generation features targeting a specific game genre and platform; to work with an existing toolchain that offers graphical editing, code generation, and automated playtesting; and to more readily generate games that are interpretable by players as examples of a particular cultural form.","Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA",University of California System,"defaultdict(<class 'list'>, {'CP': ['IEEE Conference on Games (IEEE CoG)'], 'PU': ['IEEE'], 'PI': ['NEW YORK'], 'PA': ['345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA'], 'J9': ['IEEE CONF COMPU INTE'], 'WE': ['Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)']})",2325-4270,,2021,,,727,734,10.1109/COG52621.2021.9619109,WOS:000842962500092,"['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2', 'Total Times Cited:  2', 'Cited Reference Count:  48']",WOS,,,['IEEE']

Training a generator without a dataset suffers from feedback sparsity, since it is unlikely to generate a playable level via random exploration. A common solution is shaped rewards, which guides the generator to achieve subgoals towards level playability, but they consume effort to design and require gamespecific domain knowledge. This paper proposes a novel approach to train generators without datasets or shaped rewards by learning at multiple level sizes starting from small sizes and up to the desired sizes. The denser feedback at small sizes negates the need for shaped rewards. Additionally, the generators learn to build levels at various sizes, including sizes they were not trained for. We apply our approach to train recurrent autoregressive generative flow networks (GFlowNets) for controllable level generation. We also adapt diversity sampling to be compatible with GFlowNets. The results show that our generators create diverse playable levels at various sizes for Sokoban, Zelda, and Danger Dave. When compared with controllable reinforcement learning level generators for Sokoban, the results show that our generators achieve better controllability and competitive diversity, while being 9x faster at training and level generation.

This article examines a sample of eight newsgame designs and the mechanisms through which they transmit information on issues related to political activity. We designed a qualitative analysis tool to examine the journalistic and gaming quality of the newsgames by analysing 28 parameters in four categories: formal parameters, content parameters, quality of use and architecture and design. Our results show that the use of playful elements is compatible with the fulfilment of journalistic quality standards and the choice of mechanics and dynamics determines how the user perceives and interacts with the information. However, the balance between both aspects does not guarantee that a newsgame provides the narrative resources to understand the information autonomously. Thus, newsgames are a genre with great journalistic potential when using the correct choice of mechanics and dynamics that allows communicating information according to news standards.","Univ Miguel Hernandez Elche, Avinguda Univ Elx S-N,03202 Elx, Alicante 03206, Spain",Universidad Miguel Hernandez de Elche,"defaultdict(<class 'list'>, {'PU': ['SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC'], 'PI': ['THOUSAND OAKS'], 'PA': ['2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA'], 'J9': ['CONVERGENCE-US'], 'JI': ['Convergence'], 'WE': ['Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)']})",1354-8565,JUN,2020,26,3,517,536,10.1177/1354856520918081,WOS:000532377500001,"['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  8', 'Total Times Cited:  10', 'Cited Reference Count:  52']",WOS,1354856520918081,APR 2020,

Music is one of these applications that has gotten a lot of attention in the previous several years. AI-based creative and clever solutions have altered the music industry. These technologies make it incredibly easy for composers to create high-quality music. Artificial intelligence and music (AIM) is a new field that is being utilized to create and manage sounds for a variety of media, including the Internet, video games, and so on. Sounds in games are incredibly effective and can be made even more appealing with the use of AI techniques. The quality of the game's noises has a direct impact on the player's productivity and enjoyment. Game designers can use computer-assisted technologies to create sounds for various scenarios or situations in a game, such as horror, suspense, and conveying information to the player. A game's useful and effective audio can assist visually challenged players during various game events. A high level of musicology knowledge is required for better music creation and composition. AIM has made a variety of sophisticated and interactive tools available for efficient and effective music learning. The goal of this work is to provide a comprehensive assessment of the literature on AI-assisted music classification in video games. The study exhibited literature analysis from a variety of viewpoints, which will be used by researchers to develop new solutions in the sector.","Zhengzhou Normal Univ, Mus & Dance Dept, Zhengzhou 450000, Henan, Peoples R China",Zhengzhou Normal University,"defaultdict(<class 'list'>, {'PU': ['SPRINGER'], 'PI': ['NEW YORK'], 'PA': ['ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES'], 'J9': ['SOFT COMPUT'], 'JI': ['Soft Comput.'], 'WE': ['Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)']})",1432-7643,2023 APR 17,2023,,,,,10.1007/s00500-023-08093-0,WOS:000970708100005,"['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  3', 'Total Times Cited:  3', 'Cited Reference Count:  71']",WOS,,APR 2023,

GPT-3.5 is used to generate content when it hasn't been scripted manually and to update game state by asking questions about whether a player's input achieves a particular game goal.

The proposal is portable and extensible, and allows games to not only be defined at engine level but also includes specific features that can lead the game design process whilst simultaneously reducing the gap between game specification and its corresponding game implementation. XVGDL is as generic as possible, making it possible to describe different genres of games. This paper focuses on presenting the basis of the language. The paper describes the syntax as well as the components of XVGDL, and provides examples of their use. Defining games via XML structures provides all the advantages of the management of XML files and opens up interesting lines of research. Our proposal provides a number of novel features. So, XVGDL game definitions can be managed as any other XML file, which means that it can be automatically handled by any XML file management software. Another interesting feature is that XVGDL can specify game components (e.g., game Artificial), in-game processes (e.g., the procedural generation of maps) or in-game events (e.g., the checking of the conditions to end a game match) via the association with external (possibly non-XML) files. Moreover, XVGDL files can be easily validated as any XML file what means that validations against a particular Document Type Definition (DTD) or XML Schema Definition (XSD) are possible. In addition, the paper presents a first prototype implementation of a (text-based) interpreter that allows XVGDL game specifications as a playable game to be executed. This tool not only validates our proposal but also represents a first step towards smoothing the path to obtaining an executable version of a game from its game specification.","Univ Malaga, Dept Lenguajes & Ciencias Comp, Malaga 29071, Spain",Universidad de Malaga,"defaultdict(<class 'list'>, {'FU': ['Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO) [TIN2017-85727-C4-1-P]; Universidad de Malaga'], 'FX': ['This work was supported in part by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO) DeepBio under Grant TIN2017-85727-C4-1-P, and in part by the Universidad de Malaga.'], 'PU': ['IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC'], 'PI': ['PISCATAWAY'], 'PA': ['445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA'], 'J9': ['IEEE ACCESS'], 'JI': ['IEEE Access'], 'WE': ['Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)']})",2169-3536,,2020,8,,4679,4692,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2962969,WOS:000549780500003,"['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  3', 'Total Times Cited:  3', 'Cited Reference Count:  20']",WOS,,,

Efficient tools for urban design and visualization are essential for city planners and stakeholders to better understand the valuation impact of plans for future sustainable development. Current urban design methods are mainly based on a 2D perspective and lack vertical visualization. Although conventional 3D modeling was introduced to address these limitations, it still has some challenges, such as requiring powerful computing resources and specialized training. Procedural 3D modeling is a grammar-based set of rules that can effectively generate 3D models and enhance spatial visualization when compared with conventional 2D or 3D methods. This paper describes a framework for developing a geodesign tool in Old Town Pocatello, Idaho, USA using procedural modeling to improve planning and visualization for urban design, including (1) Geospatial data preparation in ArcGIS, (2) 3D cityscape model generation in CityEngine, and (3) interactive visualization applications for multiple platforms developed with the Unity game engine. Pocatello is a mid-sized city in southeast Idaho that faces several challenges towards integrating ecosystem services in urban design. As a case study in ecosystem service modelling, we proposed a green scenario for Old Town to demonstrate a tool where permeable surfaces were increased from 37% to 45% to help mitigate urban land surface temperature and improve stormwater management. This geodesign tool offers city planners and stakeholders an opportunity to visualize and analyze block-level scenarios in real time. The interactive applications can encourage public participation in the design process. More ES measurements can be implemented into this tool in the future. The techniques of 3D procedural modeling and ES modeling in this study are also applicable to other small to mid-sized cities worldwide.","Idaho State Univ, Dept Geosci, Pocatello, ID 83209 USA",Idaho State University,"defaultdict(<class 'list'>, {'FU': [""Idaho EPSCoR's Managing Idaho's Landscapes for Ecosystem Services (MILES) program (National Science Foundation) [IIa-1301792]; Center for Advanced Energy Studies (CAES)""], 'FX': [""This study was funded by Idaho EPSCoR's Managing Idaho's Landscapes for Ecosystem Services (MILES) program (National Science Foundation award number IIa-1301792) and by Center for Advanced Energy Studies (CAES).""], 'PU': ['MDPI'], 'PI': ['BASEL'], 'PA': ['ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND'], 'J9': ['LAND-BASEL'], 'JI': ['Land'], 'WE': ['Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)']})",2073-445X,AUG,2022,11,8,,,10.3390/land11081228,WOS:000846518200001,"['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2', 'Total Times Cited:  3', 'Cited Reference Count:  52']",WOS,1228,,

This research proposes a new process for developing augmented reality serious games (ARSGs), which comprises three phases: analysis, configuration, and generation. The analysis phase involves examining the standard project structure of a typical serious game to identify the applicable actions to which AR content can be added. The configuration phase involves configuring the AR features and the AR library to be integrated into the game structure. Finally, the generation phase entails inserting the AR code in the game structure, as well as all the files necessary to in-corporate AR features in the game. Our process allows generating ARSGs step by step, both easily and rapidly. To implement this process, we propose an ARSG development software architecture. The underlying assumption of this architecture is that software development tools are essential validation elements of the software generation process. By implementing our ARSG development process through a software architecture, we provide users with a formal, automated method for creating ARSGs. The ARSG development process and the architecture, collectively called ZeusAR, are not dependent on specific software development technologies and/or programming languages. To perform a proof-of-concept of our process, we developed an ARSG generator tool based on the proposed architecture and conducted a case study in which geometry ARSGs are developed to help high school students learn about geometric shapes and their properties. We conducted a qualitative evaluation of the ZeusAR tool through a System-Usability-Scale (SUS) based survey, which was administered to a group of geometry teachers to evaluate the tool's characteristics, such as ease of use and ease of configuration.

In order to evaluate the methodology, we analyse the nature of the tropes and their distributions in existing films, the performance of the models and the quality of the sets of tropes synthesized. The results of this proof of concept show that the methodology works and is able to build sets of tropes that maximize the rating and that these sets are genuine.

Using procedural generation, No Man's Sky offers nearly infinite planets, flora, and fauna on the fly. With the rapid development of gaming technology and tools, game developers and others are attempting to diversify the representation of various forms of nature in gaming content and to expand the use of games in behavioral change, education, conservation, and other fields. Many scholars argue that games offer promising ways for various publics to understand their place and their interconnectedness with microbes, ecosystems, planet Earth, and beyond. We examine how No Man's Sky struggled to coproduce digital outer space natures at the two scalar extremes of the vast expanse of outer space and of the embodied player relating within complex biomes. Our results from an in-depth, qualitative analysis of the initial version of the game, of player world-building experiences in No Man's Sky, and of subsequent developer modifications to the game demonstrate that nonscalability theory is useful for studying what digital outer space natures do in games. We also argue that nonscalability theory would benefit from a more robust engagement with the digital. No Man's Sky was initially scalable to such an extreme that it made players into objects without an origin story, broader purpose or way to build meaningful relations in the game. For a brief period, this game undermined players' interplanetary colonial imaginaries. Subsequent updates to the game introduced a limited scope of nonscalability, but only to the extent of satisfying gamers' desires to become more impactful agents of exploration. We see great potential for analyzing the role of innovations in computing and game design in linking multiscalar digital, outer, and earth spaces, which as other scholars have shown, bear significantly on our understanding of multiple worlds and natures.","Univ Vermont, Burlington, VT 05405 USA",University of Vermont,"defaultdict(<class 'list'>, {'FU': ['College of Arts and Sciences (CAS) Academic Programs for Learning and Engagement (APLE) award (University of Vermont)'], 'FX': ['The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Emma Tait received a College of Arts and Sciences (CAS) Academic Programs for Learning and Engagement (APLE) award (University of Vermont) to purchase copies of NMS for the research participants to play.'], 'PU': ['SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC'], 'PI': ['THOUSAND OAKS'], 'PA': ['2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA'], 'J9': ['ENVIRON PLAN E-NAT'], 'JI': ['Environ.

In this work, we present a novel framework for automatic plan generation that utilizes text-based representations of students' actions within a game-based learning environment, Crystal Island, to inform adaptive scaffolding of student goal setting and planning, which are critical elements of self-regulated learning. Plan generation is the task of automatically generating a set of low-level actions that contribute toward accomplishing a target goal given a sequence of student gameplay and their prior completed goals. We investigate the use of two pre-trained large language models, T5 and GPT-3.5, in the plan generation framework. The models utilize 144 middle school students gameplay data, encompassing a total of 11,610 event sequences, as input. The plans generated by the model are subsequently evaluated against plans crafted by students during gameplay utilizing an in-game planning support tool in Crystal Island. We compare automatically generated plans to students' manually generated in terms of the number of matching low-level actions, the number of actions that match when mapped to higher-level categories of actions, and the distribution of categories of actions within plans. Results indicate that automatically generated plans from both models largely align in terms of the high-level categories of actions that are included, but the generated plans feature fewer low-level actions than students' plans. Plans generated by T5 align more closely with student plans, whereas GPT-3.5, though not following student planning patterns, produces valid plans as well. These findings suggest that LLMs show significant promise for automatically generating plans that can be used to devise run-time adaptive scaffolding for student planning in game-based learning environments.","North Carolina State Univ, Comp Sci, Raleigh, NC 27606 USA",North Carolina State University,"defaultdict(<class 'list'>, {'FU': ['National Science Foundation [DUE-1761178, DRL-2112635]; National Science Foundation'], 'FX': ['This research was supported by funding from the National Science Foundation under grants DUE-1761178 and DRL-2112635.

Testing games is a difficult task requiring a lot of manual effort since the interaction space in the game is very fine grained and requires a certain level of intelligence that cannot be easily automated. This makes testing a costly activity in the overall development of games. This paper presents a model-based formulation of game play testing in such a way that search-based testing can be applied for test generation. An abstraction of the desired game behaviour is captured in an extended finite state machine (EFSM) and search-based algorithms are used to derive abstract tests from the model, which are then concretised into action sequences that are executed on the game under test. The approach is implemented in a prototype tool EvoMBT. We carried out experiments on a 3D game to assess the suitability of the approach in general, and search-based test generation in particular. We applied 5 search algorithms for test generation on three different models of the game. Results show that search algorithms are able to achieve reasonable coverage on models: between 75% and 100% for the small and medium sized models, and between 29% and 56% for the bigger model. Mutation analysis shows that on the actual game application tests kill up to 99% of mutants.

Analysis and simulation tools based on geometric, semantic, morphological, and structural information at the urban scale level offer the scientific foundation for all the activities required for identifying, detecting, planning, training, and analyzing vulnerability that may threaten human lives in urban environments. Nevertheless, the literature research showed that samples of operational Digital Twins incorporating simulation capabilities are impracticable for small municipalities and rural, low-income communities due to their complex infrastructure, hardware, and data requirements. It is desirable to reduce the requirements for these Digital Twins and still be capable of running comprehensive and accurate simulations based on urban-scale geospatial information.

The Digital Twin is connected with the traffic simulation SUMO and the Game Engine Unity for visualization using the TraCI middleware. The middleware is extended with additional functionalities and acts as an authoring tool. Unity allows visualizations in VR.

This study introduces an adaptive reinforcement learning framework known as RALF through Cellular Learning Automata (CLA) to generate content automatically for students with dyslexia.

Second, Persian words are generated algorithmically. This process also considers each character's state to decide the alphabet cursiveness and the cells' response to the environment. Finally, RALF can generate long texts and sentences using the embedded word-formation algorithm. The spaces between words are proceeds through the CLA neighboring states. Besides, RALF provides word pronunciation and several exams and games to improve the learning performance of people with dyslexia. The proposed reinforcement learning tool enhances students' learning rate with dyslexia by almost 27% compared to the face-to-face approach.

To assess the effectiveness of this method, a 6-month Chinese-English bilingual extracurricular reading comparative experiment was conducted involving 85 grade 5 students from two classes in a primary school in Hangzhou, China. The AI-assisted class freely read 100 bilingual/English electronic picture books and 200 Chinese electronic classic serial picture books by employing the AI-assisted human-computer interactive electronic reading mode of the ""Educational Robot+Audio Electronic Picture Book+Character-play Based Reading."" In contrast, the paper book group read the same content presented in the traditional paper book format, following the ""regular independent reading"" mode. Post-experimental analyses were conducted employing t-tests and MANCOVA and the results revealed that: the primary factors influencing reading effectiveness are the choice of reading materials, reading tools, and reading mode, while reading time does not emerge as the principal influencing factor. Furthermore, students in the AI class demonstrated significant enhancements in bilingual reading motivation, reading amount, reading comprehension, independent learning ability, pronunciation proficiency, and test scores compared to their peers in the paper book class. The AI-assisted reading mode utilizing educational robots garnered positive feedback from teachers, parents, and students. It offers the potential to effectively substitute parental involvement in parent-child reading and English tutoring, while also enabling the simultaneous acquisition of bilingual proficiency in both Chinese and English. This approach proves to be highly effective, cost-efficient, and convenient, particularly for enhancing children's foreign language abilities. Moreover, it fosters positive reading habits and independent learning skills among primary school students, contributes to the establishment of lofty aspirations, and enhances bilingual performance. Overall, this innovative mode offers an effective means of facilitating children's acquisition of bilingualism and foreign language skills, as well as promoting reading education.","Zhejiang Int Studies Univ, Sch English Studies, Hangzhou, Peoples R China",Zhejiang International Studies University,"defaultdict(<class 'list'>, {'FU': ['This research was funded by 2022 National Young Pioneers of China Research Project of The National Work Committee of the Chinese Young Pioneers (Project No.: 2022YB22); ""Research on the Application of AI Educational Robots in Primary School Spoken English [2022YB22]; National Young Pioneers of China Research Project of The National Work Committee of the Chinese Young Pioneers [2022013, 2021SCG344]; ""Research on the Application of AI Educational Robots in Primary School Spoken English Exercises""'], 'FX': ['This research was funded by 2022 National Young Pioneers of China Research Project of The National Work Committee of the Chinese Young Pioneers (Project No.: 2022YB22); ""Research on the Application of AI Educational Robots in Primary School Spoken English Exercises"" (Project No.: 2022013) of ""Artificial Intelligence Enhancing Language Learning"" Research Project of China Education Association for International Exchange; ""Experimental Research on the Synchronous Development of Chinese-English Bilingual Ability of Primary School Students Through AI Educational Robots"" (Project No.: 2021SCG344) of 2021 Annual Planning Projects of Zhejiang Education Science (Higher Institutions).'], 'PU': ['FRONTIERS MEDIA SA'], 'PI': ['LAUSANNE'], 'PA': ['AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND'], 'J9': ['FRONT PSYCHOL'], 'JI': ['Front.

Methodology The study involved 80 undergraduate students: 40 students pursuing an AA degree and 40 pursuing an AS degree. The design of the innovation game incorporated cognitivist learning strategies based on Bloom's taxonomy. Innovation skills were evaluated through an open-ended achievement test. Findings The study revealed that DGBL effectively enhances product innovation skills by integrating cognitive strategies, and Bloom's Taxonomy into guided answers, and open-ended achievement tests. AS students excelled in problem identification and idea creation, while AA students emphasised psychological, emotional factors and visualisation representation. Significance The findings suggest promoting interdisciplinary collaboration among educators and policymakers to integrate aesthetics and technological knowledge. This approach enables students from diverse disciplines to leverage their strengths for holistic innovation. For practical applications, game designers and educators can model product innovation steps, offer guided answers, track progress and award virtual badges. The open-ended achievement test is a valuable tool for assessing innovation skills across diverse student backgrounds. Future studies should focus on integrating cognitivism and constructivism in collaborative learning, using generative AI- assisted assessment, and bridging virtual idea generation with real- world product idea pitching using voice-input technologies. In conclusion, this study provides practical guidelines for implementing DGBL in product innovation, influencing education, policy-making, and design practices.","Tunku Abdul Rahman Univ Management & Technol, Fac Informat Technol & Comp, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",UCSI University,"defaultdict(<class 'list'>, {'FX': ['This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.'], 'PU': ['UNIV UTARA MALAYSIA PRESS'], 'PI': ['SINTOK'], 'PA': ['UNIV UTARA MALAYSIA PRESS, SINTOK, KEDAH 06010, MALAYSIA'], 'J9': ['MALAYS J LEARN INSTR'], 'JI': ['Malays.

This article reports new research that followed a design science approach to develop and investigate a co-creative tool called Sport Sparks in one profession - the coaching of professional football players. In response to a coach entering a text description of a coaching challenge (e.g., struggling to maintain the fitness of an athlete) into the tool, the tool automatically generated potentially novel ideas (e.g., reducing game time and changing their nutrition) that the coach could select and/or adapt and evolve into a simple action plan (e.g., which links nutrition to increased game time). This Sport Sparks tool was designed to be an example of human-centred artificial intelligence that aspires to empower humans, to deliver high levels of human control as well as automation, and empower people rather than emulate their expertise. It was engineered with rule-based reasoning to automate the generation of potential new ideas that coaches could select and refine during interactions which provide high user control over this automation. The potential of such a co-creative tool, and value of the guidelines, were demonstrated during the tool's evaluation by coaching practitioners at a Premier League football club. The practitioners used the tool to generate new ideas to coaching challenges, and reported evidence of different forms of creative thinking, although some also reported the need for more support for creative collaborations and solution planning.

If they are relevant to the problem they solve, most of them are platform- or language-dependent. To solve this problem, the use of formal models for scenario or activity generation is essential to ensure a high-quality experience. In this context, the use of Petri nets or automata is widespread. Based on this observation, we propose the formal CIT (content interaction time) model [37], which is dedicated to the development of interactive robotic applications and based on networks of input/output timed automata. In this paper, we propose the use of the CELTIC (Common Editor for Location Time Interaction and Content) and EDAIN (Execution Driver based on Artificial INtelligence) software platforms to allow for a simplified and generic modelling of robotic applications and their supervision based on the CIT model. We used this approach to design a serious game with the humanoid robot Nao. This game allows young people to playfully discover the ethnography exhibition at the Natural History Museum of La Rochelle, France, and the archaeology exhibition at the Sainte Croix Museum of Poitiers, France. After these experiments, we identified problems regarding dynamic adaptations of the scenario (robot listening time, speech recognition threshold...).

In this study, we develop a lightweight damage identification framework embedded with an optimized extreme learning machine (ELM) using a significantly reduced number of parameters from frequency features of the structural vibrational signals. Coupled with the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD), the frequency features were abstracted from the structural vibrational signals in the data pre-processing step. Then, a metaheuristic algorithm (chaos game optimization, CGO) was chosen to optimize the model weight of the ELM to guarantee damage identification accuracy. Once the model is trained, the structural damages can be precisely identified despite the noise-contaminated data. We validated the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed framework with a public database and compare its performance with several common metaheuristic algorithms. With the proven capability, the proposed framework shows a promising future as a handy and reliable AI-assisted digital tool for robust development in next-generation structural monitoring systems.","North China Univ Water Resources & Elect Power, Sch Civil Engn & Commun, Zhengzhou 450045, Peoples R China",North China University of Water Resources & Electric Power,"defaultdict(<class 'list'>, {'FU': ['Science and Technology Plan Project of the Guangzhou Municipal Construction Group Co., Ltd [2021KJ005]; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Modern Civil Engineering Technology [2021B1212040003]'], 'FX': ['X.

Each minute, more than 500 hours worth of videos are uploaded on YouTube. Generating engaging short videos out of the raw captured content is often a time-consuming and cumbersome activity for content creators. Existing ML-based video summarization and highlight generation approaches often neglect the fact that many summarization tasks require specific domain knowledge of the video content, and that human editors often follow a semi-structured template when creating the summary (e.g. to create the highlights for a sport event). We therefore address in this paper the challenge of creating domain-specific summaries, by actively leveraging this editorial template. Particularly, we present an Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL)-based framework that can automatically learn the hidden structure or template followed by a human expert when generating a video summary for a specific domain. Particularly, we propose to formulate the video summarization task as a Markov Decision Process, where each state is a combination of the features of the video shots added to the summary, and the possible actions are to include/remove a shot from the summary or leave it as is. Using a set of domain-specific human-generated video highlights as examples, we employ a Maximum Entropy IRL algorithm to learn the implicit reward function governing the summary generation process. The learned reward function is then used to train an RL-agent that can produce video summaries for a specific domain, closely resembling what a human expert would create. Learning from expert demonstrations allows our approach to be applicable to any domain or editorial styles. To demonstrate the superior performance of our approach, we employ it to the task of soccer games highlight generation and show that it outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, both quantitatively and qualitatively.","Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",University of California System,"defaultdict(<class 'list'>, {'CP': ['22nd IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia (IEEE ISM)'], 'PU': ['IEEE'], 'PI': ['NEW YORK'], 'PA': ['345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA'], 'J9': ['IEEE INT SYM MULTIM'], 'WE': ['Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)']})",978-1-7281-8697-9,,2020,,,210,217,10.1109/ISM.2020.00044,WOS:000654273000038,"['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1', 'Total Times Cited:  1', 'Cited Reference Count:  27']",WOS,,,['IEEE']

DALL-E Mini uses an unfiltered database of images from the internet to create new images based on a user's text prompt, often resulting in misshapen bodies and impossible scenarios. Despite its technological limitations, DALL-E Mini's popularity as a meme-making tool is visible on social media platforms, where crowd-sourced images are shared and experimentation with the tool is encouraged. Through comparison with existing artistic practices and formats (creative automata, surrealism, body horror, celebrity memes), we argue that DALL-E Mini creations can be understood as human-AI co-creations and forms of aesthetic mimicry. Building on the ideas of surrealists such as Andr ' e Breton, we propose that DALL-E Mini's images, prompts and the grid interface adhere to surrealism's historical interests in the unconscious, the uncanny, and the collaborative 'exquisite corpse' parlour game. We also consider DALL-E Mini's relevance to the category of 'AI Arts', PatriciaDe Vries's call for more research that relates algorithms to the broader artistic and cultural contexts in which they are embedded (2020), and the 'authoring' of celebrity bodies as data (Kanai, 2016). Our theorisation of DALL-E Mini is supported by examples drawn from social media and personal experiments with the generator. Overall, we propose that internet users' experimentation with DALL-E Mini corresponds with a cultural moment in which AI imaging technologies are eliciting excitement and anxiety. The outputs are revealed to be reliant on users' pop cultural knowledge, with DALL-E Mini allowing for a playful, co-creative algorithmic practice, wherein contemporary anxieties about digital labour, (post)digital culture, biopolitics, and global issues are redirected into surreal visual storyworlds.","Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Film, Dublin, Ireland",Trinity College Dublin,"defaultdict(<class 'list'>, {'FU': [""Trinity College Dublin (Provost's Project Award); Irish Research Council [IRCLA/2022/2959]""], 'FX': [""The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Trinity College Dublin (Provost's Project Award) and Irish Research Council (IRCLA/2022/2959).""], 'PU': ['SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC'], 'PI': ['THOUSAND OAKS'], 'PA': ['2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA'], 'J9': ['CONVERGENCE-US'], 'JI': ['Convergence'], 'WE': ['Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)']})",1354-8565,AUG,2023,29,4,1070,1096,10.1177/13548565231185865,WOS:001185830500016,"['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  12', 'Total Times Cited:  12', 'Cited Reference Count:  83']",WOS,,,

For instance, in pediatric healthcare, it is important to help children to feel comfortable during medical procedures and tests that may be performed on them. To tackle such an issue with the help of AR-based solutions, this article presents the design, implementation and evaluation of a novel open-source collaborative framework that enables to develop teaching, training, and monitoring pediatric healthcare applications. Specifically, such a framework allows for building collaborative applications and shared experiences for AR devices, providing functionalities for connecting with other AR devices and enabling real-time visualization and simultaneous interaction with virtual objects. Since all the communications involved in AR interactions are handled by AR devices, the proposed collaborative framework is able to operate autonomously through a Local Area Network (LAN), thus requiring no cloud or external servers. In order to demonstrate the potential of the proposed framework, a practical use case application is presented. Such an application has been designed to motivate pediatric patients and to encourage them to increase their physical activity through AR games. The presented games do not require any previous configuration, as they use ARCore automatic surface detection technology. Moreover, the AR mobile gaming framework allows multiple players to engage in the same AR experience, so children can interact and collaborate among them sharing the same AR content. In addition, the proposed AR system provides a remote web application that is able to collect and to visualize data on patient use, aiming to provide healthcare professionals with qualified data about the mobility and mood of their patients through an intuitive and user-friendly web tool. Finally, to determine the performance of the proposed AR system, this article presents its evaluation in terms of latency and processing time. The results show that both times are low enough to provide a good user experience.","Univ A Coruna, Dept Comp Engn, Fac Comp Sci, La Coruna 15071, Spain",Universidade da Coruna,"defaultdict(<class 'list'>, {'FU': ['Xunta de Galicia [ED431C 2020/15, ED431G 2019/01]; Agencia Estatal de Investigacion of Spain [RED2018-102668-T, PID2019-104958RB-C42]; ERDF funds of the EU (FEDER Galicia 2014-2020); ERDF funds of the EU (AEI/FEDER Programs, UE)'], 'FX': ['This work has been funded by the Xunta de Galicia (by grant ED431C 2020/15, and grant ED431G 2019/01 to support the Centro de Investigacion de Galicia ""CITIC""), the Agencia Estatal de Investigacion of Spain (by grants RED2018-102668-T and PID2019-104958RB-C42) and ERDF funds of the EU (FEDER Galicia 2014-2020 & AEI/FEDER Programs, UE).'], 'PU': ['MDPI'], 'PI': ['BASEL'], 'PA': ['ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND'], 'J9': ['SENSORS-BASEL'], 'JI': ['Sensors'], 'WE': ['Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)']})",1424-8220,MAR,2021,21,5,,,10.3390/s21051865,WOS:000628601300001,"['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  9', 'Total Times Cited:  10', 'Cited Reference Count:  35']",WOS,1865,,

Among the numerous applications, one of the most significant advancements due to Machine Learning is in the field of Very Large Scale Integrated Circuits (VLSI). Further growth and improvements in this field are highly anticipated in the near future. The fabrication of thousands of transistors in VLSI is time consuming and complex which demanded the automation of design process, and hence, computer-aided design (CAD) tools and technologies have started to evolve. The incorporation of machine learning in VLSI involves the application of machine learning algorithms at different abstraction levels of VLSI CAD. In this paper, we summarize several machine learning algorithms that have been developed and are being widely used. We also have briefly discussed about how machine learning methods have transuded the layers of VLSI design process from register transfer level (RTL) assertion generation to static timing analysis (STA) with smart and efficient models and methodologies, further enhancing the quality of chip design with power, performance and area improvements and complexity and turnaround time reduction.","Delhi Technol Univ DTU, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Delhi 110042, India",Delhi Technological University,"defaultdict(<class 'list'>, {'ED': ['Shakya, S', 'Bestak, R', 'Palanisamy, R', 'Kamel, KA'], 'CP': ['International Conference on Mobile Computing and Sustainable Informatics (ICMCSI)'], 'PU': ['SPRINGER-VERLAG SINGAPORE PTE LTD'], 'PI': ['SINGAPORE'], 'PA': ['152 BEACH ROAD, #21-01/04 GATEWAY EAST, SINGAPORE, 189721, SINGAPORE'], 'J9': ['LECT NOTE DATA ENG'], 'WE': ['Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)']})",2367-4512,,2022,68,,95,112,10.1007/978-981-16-1866-6_6,WOS:000850167200006,"['Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  4', 'Total Times Cited:  4', 'Cited Reference Count:  24']",WOS,,,

An observation experiment was subsequently conducted to reveal that the training program can be redesigned according to the concrete operation effects and influencing factors for operational efficiency in the workplace.FindingsThe proposed service efficiency-oriented training model is suggested to underline and guide the activities for training requirements, training methods, training criteria and training evaluation for the service sector. Training auditing, analyzing and redesigning based on service efficiency could help to integrate service efficiency so that service organizations can readjust their specific training needs and concise the training program in the human resource management practice.Research limitations/implicationsThis study only conducted an on-site observational experiment on one of the casinos in Macau. An observational method assessed the conceptual model in the context of table game operations. More quantitative approaches like AI-assisted systems may be employed in the future. The representativeness of the sample is somewhat limited. In addition, the service efficiency-oriented training concept model is an open system that any organization could extend by incorporating more elements in each part that can be developed to meet their human resource management needs. Finally, other service-oriented organizations like airlines and banks can learn from the theoretical model proposed in this article. It is suggested that non-profit organizations would be a better research area.Practical implicationsThe finding can provide organizations and practitioners with insights and tools on how to provide and evaluate service efficiency and assess employee performance.Social implicationsThe proposed service efficiency-oriented training model provides a theoretical foundation for training and organizational performance for service organizations.Originality/valueThis study is the first to develop a service efficiency-oriented training framework with training needs, methods, criteria and evaluation.

Thus, AI-assisted diagnosis is considered as a possible solution for this issue. Despite the great advances brought by deep learning and especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems are still not used in clinical practice. This may be explained by the dermatologist's fear of being misled by a false negative and the assimilation of CNNs to a ""black box"", making their decision process difficult to understand by a non-expert. Decision theory, especially game theory, is a potential solution as it focuses on identifying the best decision option that maximizes the decision-maker's expected utility. This study presents a new framework for automated melanoma diagnosis. Pursuing the goal of improving the performance of existing systems, our approach also attempts to bring more transparency in the decision process. The proposed framework includes a multi-class CNN and six binary CNNs assimilated to players. The players' strategies is to first cluster the pigmented lesions (melanoma, nevus, and benign keratosis), using the introduced method of evaluating the confidence of the predictions, into confidence level (confident, medium, uncertain). Then, a subset of players has the strategy to refine the diagnosis for difficult lesions with medium and uncertain prediction. We used EfficientNetB5 as the backbone of our networks and evaluated our approach on the public ISIC dataset consisting of 8917 lesions: melanoma (1113), nevi (6705) and benign keratosis (1099). The proposed framework achieved an area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) of 0.93 for melanoma, 0.96 for nevus and 0.97 for benign keratosis. Furthermore, our approach outperformed existing methods in this task, improving the balanced accuracy (BACC) of the best compared method from 77% to 86%. These results suggest that our framework provides an effective and explainable decision-making strategy. This approach could help dermatologists in their clinical practice for patients with atypical and difficult-to-diagnose pigmented lesions. We also believe that our system could serve as a didactic tool for less experienced dermatologists.","Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, LIS, F-13288 Marseille, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"defaultdict(<class 'list'>, {'FU': ['French National Research Agency through the DIAMELEX project [ANR-20-CE45-0026]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-20-CE45-0026] Funding Source: Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)'], 'FX': ['This research was funded by the French National Research Agency through the DIAMELEX project with grant number ANR-20-CE45-0026 (https://anr.fr/Projet-ANR-20-CE45-0026, accessed on 8 november 2022).'], 'PU': ['MDPI'], 'PI': ['BASEL'], 'PA': ['ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND'], 'J9': ['INT J MOL SCI'], 'JI': ['Int.

The SmartSpeech project aims to assist clinicians in decision making regarding early diagnosis for children with neurodevelopmental disorders. SmartSpeech employs a serious game designed explicitly by the interdisciplinary team for this project, with activities aiming to evaluate the child's developmental profile. The game is implemented in a tablet application and utilizes voice, and biomarkers of heart rate and gaze, for additional physiological measurements. A back-end system supports user registration, data collection, data analysis, and decision making. The potential application of this work is to allow the SmartSpeech machine learning model to better capture underlying patterns in the data, determine the most effective feature construction techniques for the given problem, and employ the results of this study to enhance the screening automated prediction results of the machine learning model in neurodevelopmental disorders.Abstract Developmental domains refer to different areas of a child's growth and maturation, including physical, language, cognitive, and social-emotional skills. Understanding these domains helps parents, caregivers, and professionals track a child's progress and identify potential areas of concern. Nevertheless, due to the high level of heterogeneity and overlap, neurodevelopmental disorders may go undiagnosed in children for a crucial period. Detecting neurodevelopmental disorders at an early stage is fundamental. Digital tools like artificial intelligence can help clinicians with the early detection process. To achieve this, a new method has been proposed that creates artificial features from the original ones derived from the SmartSpeech project, using a feature construction procedure guided by the Grammatical Evolution technique. The new features from a machine learning model are used to predict neurodevelopmental disorders. Comparative experiments demonstrated that using the feature creation method outperformed other machine learning methods for predicting neurodevelopmental disorders. In many cases, the reduction in the test error reaches up to 65% to the next better one.","Univ Ioannina, Sch Hlth Sci, Dept Speech & Language Therapy, Panepistimioupoli B 45500, Ioannina, Greece",University of Ioannina,"defaultdict(<class 'list'>, {'FU': ['European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)'], 'FX': ['We wish to thank all the participants for their valuable contribution in this study as well as administrative and technical support.'], 'PU': ['MDPI'], 'PI': ['BASEL'], 'PA': ['ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND'], 'J9': ['APPL SCI-BASEL'], 'JI': ['Appl.

This new paradigm empowers demand-side agents to play a more active role through coordinating, cooperating, and negotiating with other agents. Nevertheless, most of these agents are not used to process market signals and develop optimal strategies, especially in the residential sector. Accordingly, it is indispensable to create tools that automate and facilitate demand-side participation in TE systems. This paper presents a new methodology for residential automated agents to perform two key tasks: prevision and planning. Specifically, the proposed method is applied to a forward market where agents' planning is a fundamental step to maintain the dynamic balance between demand and generation. Since planning depends on future demand, agents' prevision of consumption is an inevitable part of this step. The procedures for automating the targeted tasks are developed in a general way for residential prosumers and consumers, interacting at the distribution level. These players are managed by a demand aggregator as the leader by means of the Stackelberg game. The suggested process results in a TE setup for multi-stage single-side auctions, useful to manage future Smart Energy Markets. Through simulated transactions, this paper examines the market clearing mechanism and the convenience of agents' planning. The results show that customers with higher price elasticity leverage lower costs periods. However, they make it harder to reduce the peak-to-average ratio of the aggregated demand profile since a unique price signal can create prisoner's dilemma conditions. & COPY; 2021 The Author(s).

With significant developments in computer graphics tools, deep learning methods, and immersive experiences (metaverse), there is a need to study its seamless adaptation to AR-based manufacturing-specific scenarios, especially for worker training. In this work, we develop an augmented reality-based worker training framework aimed at helping novice technicians with complex machine component identification in several smart factory tasks and shop-floor training environments. A Deep-Learning (DL) semantic segmentation network U-Net, prominently applied in several manufacturing use cases, is enhanced for detailed pixel-level component identification. We formulated an automatic synthetic image generation algorithm that uses computer-aided design (CAD) models generated using Siemens NX to create images and automatic labels for training the neural network. These images are custom-rendered with variable lighting and randomized orientations to mimic real-life occlusions and improve data diversity for neural network training. In this approach, arbitrary textured materials are assigned to the 3D objects through Blender, an open-source computer graphics software using Python programming in the input scene environment. The background for these images is set from the multiple real-world environment scenes. A custom Python script integrated into Blender captures the image snapshots through the built-in camera system. It automatically separates render and mask images, thus saving time on the tedious manual labeling process. We pass the virtual images (both render and mask images) to the DL pipeline for training. After training the data through Pytorch and CUDA parallel computing, the Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) format output model is imported to the AR app. The application is developed using the Unity 3D game engine platform and deployed on Android. Specifically, the Unity Barracuda toolkit maps the input and output tensors as rendering textures and recognizes components in colored pixels. We present a prototype three-a stage automotive engine assembly case study to evaluate the proposed framework's effectiveness. The engine components include tools (mallet, chisel, wrench), machine tooling equipment (nuts, bolts, Allen keys, screwdriver), and assembly equipment (engine piston, cylinder head, and camshaft). The 3D-printed components mimicking engine parts are identified in real-time along their exact pixel-level contours in the AR app. This framework can extend AR-based methods to visualize components in complex wiring, cluttered environments, and intricate assemblies on the factory floor, reducing the training time performed through conventional approaches and providing an interactive training approach through gamification.","Univ Cincinnati, Ctr Global Design & Mfg, Dept Mech & Mat Engn, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA",University System of Ohio,"defaultdict(<class 'list'>, {'CP': ['ASME 19th International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference (MSEC) held jointly with the 52nd North American Research Conference (NAMRC)'], 'FU': ['University of Cincinnati Digital Futures Graduate Student Fellows Program'], 'FX': ['This work was supported through the ""The University of Cincinnati Digital Futures Graduate Student Fellows Program.""
